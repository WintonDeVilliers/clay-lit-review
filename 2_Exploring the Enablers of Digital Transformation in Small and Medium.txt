Exploring the Enablers of Digital Transformation in Small and Medium- Sized Enterprises
ABSTRACT
Recently, digital transformation has caught much attention of both academics and practitioners. With the advent of digital technologies, small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have obtained the capacity to initiate digital transformation initiatives in a similar fashion to large-sized organizations. The innate characteristics of digital technologies also favor SMEs in promoting initiation of digital transformation. However, the process digital transformation in SMEs remains a black box and the existing findings of digital transformation in SMEs are limited and remain fragmented. Considering the important contribution SMEs can offer to nations and economies; it is timely and relevant to conduct a profound analysis on digital transformation in SMEs. By conducting a thorough review of existing related literature in management, information systems, and business disciplines, this book chapter aims to understand both internal and external enablers of the digital transformation in SMEs.
Keywords: Digitalization, Digital Transformation, Enablers, SMEs, Literature Review
INTRODUCTION
In recent times, digital technologies (i.e., social media, mobile technologies, analytics, cloud computing, and internet-of-things), also known as SMAC-IoT have provided myriad prospects for all businesses despite their size (Kraus et al., 2021; Lokuge et al., 2019). For example, in the past, only large-sized organizations with financial capacity had access to resources, the ability to invest in technologies and lead innovation in their respective organizations (Lokuge & Sedera, 2020). As such, technology-led innovation was limited to larger, resourceful organizations (Lokuge & Sedera, 2016; Tan et al., 2017). However, in recent times, digital technologies have disrupted the norms and have given rise to concepts such as digital transformation which has become a buzzword in the business landscape (Vial, 2019).
Digital transformation refers to “the use of digital technologies to create value-added products and processes in organizations and integrate them into business processes, organizational structures, and working models” (Warner and Wäger (2019). As per Vial (2019, p. 118) digital transformation is “a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies.” Wessel, Baiyere, Ologeanu- Taddei, Cha, and Jensen (2020), extends this conversation and highlights that digital technology plays a key role in digital transformation, whereby they initiate a new organizational identity to develop. Digital transformation enables improved decision-making, value augmentation and improved customer services. The whole objective of investing in digital technologies in organizations is to develop new organizational capabilities for attaining a competitive edge over the market competition (Adikari et al., 2021; Lokuge et al., 2019; Vial, 2019). With the ever-changing customer requirements, advancement of modern technologies and the new normal introduced through COVID-19 pandemic, all organizations, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are interested in digital transformation initiatives considering its benefits.
SMEs are considered as the backbone of the global economy (Deng et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018). For example, in Australia alone 90% of the organizations that contribute to the national income are SMEs (Duan

 et al., 2012).
Therefore, an investigation into the digital transformation in SMEs will assist in uncovering enormous benefits offered through the introduction of digital technologies. As a result of such digital transformations, SMEs will in
turn be able to contribute to the economic growth of the community, society, and country.
In defining SMEs, various definitions have been adopted in various countries (Beck et al., 2005; Duan et al., 2012). In general, SMEs are defined as enterprises with less than 250 employees (Beck et al., 2005). SMEs are considered as a distinguished group from large-sized organizations as they possess innate characteristics such as technical incapabilities, limited resources and infrastructure, over influence of the SME owner, lack of control, inadequate capital, high dependence on business partners, informal planning, lack of formal culture, and uncertainty (Deng et al., 2019; King et al., 2014; Nagahawatta et al., 2021). However, on a positive side, SMEs are considered as more agile, flexible, and responsive to market needs (Ghobadian & Gallear, 1997; Li et al., 2018; Sedera & Lokuge, 2017). As such, organizational theories, and day-to-day practices that are relevant for a large-sized organization might not be suitable for a SME (Ghobadian & Gallear, 1997; North et al., 2019; Salim et al., 2015; Szopa & Cyplik, 2020).
Prior research has attempted to unfold the complex process of digital transformation by investigating the strategy of an organization (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Sedera et al., 2022), its influence on organizational structure (Selander & Jarvenpaa, 2016), business processes (Vial, 2019), and the organizational culture (Karimi & Walter, 2015). Such studies, however, have mostly focused on understanding the digital transformation in large-sized organizations or have taken an “one-size-fits-all” approach regardless of unique features of SMEs. Considering the importance of digital transformation and the unique characteristics of SMEs, it is considered highly timely and relevant to unravel the black box of digital transformation projects among SMEs (Argüelles et al., 2021; Crupi et al., 2020; Gupta & Bose, In Press; Kraus et al., 2021; Lokuge & Duan, 2021; Wessel et al., 2020). In recent times, researchers have seen the value of studying digital transformation in SMEs and have focused on investigating this topic. Even though, there is an interest among scholars in understanding this topic, the extant knowledge regarding the process of digital transformation of SMEs remain limited and disjointed (Ab Wahid & Aziidah Zulkifli, 2021; Garzoni et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Lokuge & Duan, 2021). Further, the importance and the unique features of SMEs in the contemporary economic conditions warrant an investigation into the topic of digital transformation in SMEs. As such, a review of the related literature on digital transformation in SMEs can provide a clear understanding of the topic and thereby fill the gap to inform researchers. As such, the proposed overarching research question of this study is derived as follows:
What are the internal and external enablers of digital transformation in SMEs?
In order to address this research question, the authors conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review in digital transformation in SMEs. The authors examined 71 articles to identify the enablers of digital transformations in SMEs. The enablers derived through the review of literature provide an early assessment for the SMEs for designing digital strategies for digital transformation.
The structure of this book chapter is as follows. The research method section describes the literature review method followed. The findings of the literature analysis are provided next. Finally, in the conclusion section, future research agenda, limitation and concluding remarks are provided.
RESEARCH METHOD
A literature review approach was adopted in this study as the objective of this study is to identify internal and external enablers of digital transformation in SMEs. Such an approach is beneficial as (i) it allows the authors to get an insight of the existing literature, and (ii) thereby, it helps authors to determine the research gaps. Five stages were followed for the literature review including defining the scope of the literature review, searching for the related literature, selecting, and finalizing the sample, analyzing the sample, and finalizing the findings (Wolfswinkel et al., 2013).
As such, to increase organizational efficiency, it is important for the SMEs to increase the
 application of digital technologies and initiate digital transformation (Deng et al., 2019).

When defining the scope of the literature review specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered. In this study, the authors selected journal papers from the databases such as AIS Library, INFORM, ProQuest, Wiley, Emerald, and EBSCOhost. For a broad coverage of management, business and information systems studies, keywords such as, “digital transformation,” OR “digitalization,” OR “digitization,” OR “digital disruption” AND “Small business,” “SME,” “Small and medium enterprise” were used for identifying papers. The search was limited to articles published in the English language. The authors only considered articles published before the cut-off date of 16th February 2022 for the sample when the database search was conducted. The analysis was conducted in early February, to ensure all papers considered for the analysis, the authors have considered this cutoff date.
In the next phase, the authors ran the search queries within the chosen databases for obtaining relevant publications for the analysis. Several types of articles were included such as research articles, review articles, opinion pieces, discussion papers, and letters to the editor published in scholarly journals. The search returned 133 articles.
Then, in the next phase, the authors involved screening and selecting the final samples for detailed analysis. The titles and abstracts of all initially identified articles were screened for checking the relevance to the research focus. Duplicate articles were removed. As a result, 80 articles for further review were left. The identified 80 articles have been read in full. Then, the two authors coded the papers. From this, 9 publications were removed as they were not relevant to the topic of analysis. Then, each remaining article (71 articles) identified through the search too was read completely and then determined their relevance. Table 1 below provides details of the sample. Each selected publication was analyzed and coded to identify enablers of the digital transformation process in SMEs.

Analysis
The two authors independently analyzed each of the papers identified in the literature sample. When analyzing the sample, authors identified key themes that were emerging. By conducting this approach, the authors were able to maintain an open, and free-flowing mental state that enabled absorbing the phenomenon of interest. All the papers were analyzed separately to code key enablers. When coding the literature sample, the authors labelled any important detail until the existing labels were repeated. Then, each label identified was discussed and explored. The authors refined the coded enablers that were identified independently. Discussions were made until a consensus was made for enablers of digital transformation in SMEs.
FINDINGS OF THE LITERATURE
This section provides an overview of the analysis of the literature sample. As per the sample, it was evident that the scholars in studying digital transformation in SMEs are focusing more on this topic and this is epitomized by the heightened number of papers published each year from 2013 (only one article) to 2021 (n=35). Among these papers, only a few papers (around 28) focused on studying digital transformation in a particular industry setting such as banking, manufacturing, and IT. When examining the research method adopted in these articles, it was evident that most studies (about 25 papers) followed a qualitative approach, followed by a quantitative approach (n=16), mixed method (n=9), and literature reviews (n=10). Among the papers that conducted a qualitative approach, case studies method was the most applied method and interviews were used to collect qualitative data. Among the sample that applied a quantitative approach, survey method was the most applied approach, followed by econometric modelling. The mixed-method studies mainly applied survey methods along with a few qualitative approaches. In most of the papers in the sample, maturity model as a theoretical framework was applied. In addition, in the sample, commonly used theories and frameworks were absorptive capacity, dynamic capabilities, IS success model, resource- based view, and technology, organization, and environment framework in investigating digital transformation in SMEs.
Defining Digital Transformation
The accessibility of digital technologies and the recent COVID-19 situation has forced organizations to embrace digital transformation (Argüelles et al., 2021; Vial, 2019). Verhoef et al. (2021, p. 889) define digital transformation as “a change in how a firm employs digital technologies, to develop a new digital business model that helps to create and appropriate more value for the firm.” Similarly, researchers such as Fitzgerald et al. (2014) and Lokuge et al. (2021) describe it as the application of new digital technologies to improve the organizational performance in the areas such as developing new business models, customer experience enhancement, and restructuring business operations. Vial (2019, p. 118) define digital transformation as “a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies,” Wessel et al. (2020), argue that in a digital transformation initiative a new organizational identity is emerged as a result of this transformation. In this process the organizational resources, the practices they follow, and the business strategies they follow radically transformed (Wessel et al., 2020). As per Rowe (2018), digital transformation is “the investment in people and technology to drive a business that is prepared to grow, adapt, scale, and change into the foreseeable future.” This shows that digital transformation is a process that employs digital technologies and initiates a positive organizational change in the organization. As per Verhoef et al. (2021), digitization is the starting point of digital transformation process. In digitization, organizations transform analogue data into digitized format. The next step of the digital transformation
      
process, which is digitalization, focuses on automation, value adding and digitalizing business processes. Digital transformation looks at digitalizing business models, ensuring customer and employee experience. In all these endeavors, organizations focus on positive outcomes such as increased organizational performance, increased cost efficiency, competitive advantage, and better customer services (Balakrishnan & Das, 2020; Crupi et al., 2020; Garzoni et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020; Lokuge, Sedera, Ariyachandra, et al., 2020; Pelletier & Cloutier, 2019; Sedera & Lokuge, 2019; Szopa & Cyplik, 2020).
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
SMEs are considered as an important entity of the global economy. The most important and significant part of the world economy is small businesses (Çakar & Ertürk, 2010; Hung et al., 2004; Lokuge & Duan, 2021). SMEs vary from large organizations regarding their capacity, structure, and size (Tambunan, 2019). The capacity of the SMEs is determined through staff count, assets, size, and revenue. SMEs generally differ from large-sized organizations in terms of their capacity, structure, leadership, finance, and business size (Beck et al., 2005). SMEs possess innate characteristics such as the lack of IT resources, professionals, specialized services or goods, smaller market, and are constantly looking for ways to save costs (Simpson & Docherty, 2004). However, since they have limited staff, communication is efficient, and the ability to execute and decisions making is easy (Simpson & Docherty, 2004).
SMEs are more independent, have less governance structures and are agile (Alsharari et al., 2020; Bouaynaya, 2020; Lokuge & Sedera, 2014b). As per Ghobadian and Gallear (1997), SMEs possess characteristics such as integrated power, multifunctional management, limited product range, flexibility, small management teams, inadequate organizational planning, and unsophisticated IT applications or software. Since they have small teams to manage, SMEs are more risk taking and tend to initiate new products, services and lead digital transformation initiatives. However, due to financial resource limitations, there can be restrictions for successful digital transformation initiatives that they need to manage. This book chapter details both internal and external enablers that SMEs need to consider when initiating digital transformations.
UNDERSTANDING THE ENABLERS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The analysis of literature sample emphasized several important enablers of the digital transformation in SMEs. For example, extant literature highlighted the major role of the changes and the forces in the external environment that forces digital transformation in SMEs. The tension that was arise from continuous changes in the technological landscape, ever increasing market demands, the changes to the lifestyle of the customers and unprecedented events such as the war and the pandemic force digital transformation initiatives to be launched in organizations.
Initially, the authors identified 48 enablers for digital transformation in SMEs from the literature sample. The two authors independently coded and categorized the enablers by merging synonyms and eliminating duplicated codes. In Figure 1, the overview resulted in identifying internal and external enablers of digital transformation in SMEs are shown.

 Internal Enablers

The analysis of the literature sample derived internal enablers that assisted SMEs in initiating digital transformation initiatives successfully. Figure 2 summarizes the enablers identified through the analysis. The details of each of the enablers are provided below.
Figure 2. Internal enablers for digital transformation in SMEs
Organizational Strategy: Organizational strategy is commonly defined as specified goals, objectives, policies, and plans established for operating a particular organization (Miles et al., 1978). Especially for SMEs, most of the articles in the sample emphasized the key role of the clarity of goals and objectives for a SME to conduct digital transformation projects (Nair et al., 2019; Sedera, 2006). For example, having a proper organizational strategy will not affect the digital transformation success. Proper communication of such a strategy is an important element of organizational strategy (Lokuge & Duan, 2021; Lokuge, Sedera, & Palekar, 2020). Considering the size of the SMEs, proper communication of organizational strategy may seem easier. However, it is important to ensure that this communication is properly conducted. When a digital strategy of a particular organization is developed, it is important to identify positioning of their
 
resources, mapping of their capabilities and leveraging such capabilities (Lokuge & Sedera, 2016; Pelletier & Cloutier, 2019). Since SMEs face major resource limitations, it is crucial for the SMEs to determine such capabilities for introducing a strategy that aligns with their requirements (Lokuge & Sedera, 2018, 2020; Lokuge et al., 2016; Nwaiwu et al., 2020).
Further, the criticality of top leadership involvement in managing and ensuring the alignment of such organizational strategies was also considered to be important (Ahmad et al., 2013; Lokuge et al., 2018; Philipp, 2020; Sedera & Dey, 2013; Szopa & Cyplik, 2020). For SMEs, this is one of the most cited enablers that leads to success in digital transformation initiatives. Prior literature agrees that without a proper organizational strategy, strategic initiatives have very little success (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Henfridsson & Lind, 2014; Nylén & Holmström, 2015; Tan et al., 2015).
Sustainable Technology Capabilities: IT capabilities are commonly defined as an organization’s ability to construct and use its IT-based resources (including physical IT resources and organization’s IT staff), with other organizational resources and capabilities (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Lokuge & Sedera, 2018) For a SME to ensure positive digital transformation project requires proper utilization of IT capabilities. However, SMEs are inherently possessed limitation in resources (Walther et al., 2013; Walther et al., 2018). Mathrani et al. (2013) highlight that for an SME to be successful in digital transformation projects, it is critical to manage their IT resources and capacities that includes staff, and skills to develop their competencies. Considering the lack of IT resources among SMEs, in instances where they have exclusive access to IT resources, it will determine successful launch of digital transformation initiatives (Philipp, 2020).
. Especially with the advent of digital technologies, SMEs can afford digital technologies for digital transformation initiatives (Lokuge & Sedera, 2014a). Such endeavors emphasize the criticality of IT knowledge and the capabilities of the staff (Lokuge & Sedera, 2017; Mathrani et al., 2013; Rosemann et al., 2000), which can be challenging for SME. As such,
managing technology capabilities determines digital transformation success.
Accessibility to Partnerships: As per Ghobakhloo and Iranmanesh (2021) the survival and the success of digital initiatives of the SMEs rely heavily on their capabilities to open up their boundaries to external partners.
. The accessibility to leverage the assets, knowledge, and competencies of suppliers, external partners through mergers, alliances, and joint ventures determines the strength of the network (Nuwangi et al., 2018), access to resources and the agility of the SME. In the contemporary digital business landscape, the capacity of the SME is determined through the network of the SME. With the advancement of platform culture, SMEs and all organizations do not necessarily require possessing all resources and need not to have access to resources (Lokuge & Sedera, 2019; Lokuge et al., 2019). If the SMEs have access to a network that possesses the required resources, SMEs can thrive in digital transformation initiatives. In the digital era, with the advent of the shared economy, businesses have the opportunity to engage with new partners. For example, social media provides access to real-time feedback for innovation. In addition, platform providers and mobile app developers create a new ecosystem that provides new opportunities for SMEs. Since SMEs inherently do not have necessary resources and capacity, such alliances and partnerships will create new opportunities to thrive in digital transformation
initiatives.
Flexible Organizational Controls: SMEs inherently possess no or flexible organizational hierarchy, low degree of formalization, high involvement of the top management, high visibility of the top management, close top management intervention, and high personal authority (Ghobadian & Gallear, 1997). Such characteristics reflect factors that favor innovation (Jansen et al., 2006). As such, in theory, SMEs can easily initiate digital transformation projects as they possess flexibility in organizational structures and controls. Formalization refers to coordinating and controlling the organization (Bodewes, 2002). It is important to maintain a balance between formal and informal controls. Minimal formal coordinating and controlling mechanisms leads to is a SMEs facing negative consequences such as failure of digital transformation
 However, Sedera et al. (2016) highlights that organizations can use their existing IT, such as
 enterprise systems bundling with complementary IT resources
 This includes the partners in their value chain, supply network and new partners introduced
 through new technologies (Queiroz et al., 2018)

projects. As such, while the existing organizational structures and controls of SMEs favor innovation, managing organizational coordination and control are important for SMEs. As such, a balanced organizational structure and control will determine the success of digital transformation initiatives of SMEs.
Skilled People: The skilled people enabler entails, knowledge, empowerment, expertise, leadership, and involvement of the managers. Considering digital transformation projects as an innovation to the organization, it can be argued that in all prior literature on innovation the researchers emphasize the importance of managers in leading innovation (Damanpour & Aravind, 2012; Lokuge, Sedera, & Palekar, 2020). As digital transformation process is a radical technological project, managers role is important (Kohli & Melville, 2019). Similarly, in the literature sample most of the papers emphasized the critical role of managers in sharing their knowledge, expertise, leadership, practices that enable successful projects (Crupi et al., 2020). As top management involvement, and support are relatively high in SMEs compared to large organization, digital transformation projects relatively highly successfully in the SME context. In addition, managerial staff are required to educate themselves and reignite their innovation cognition and enhance managerial social capital to promote such projects (Li et al., 2018). As a result, the manager's
Further, possessing skilled people is also associated with accessibility to partnerships as partnerships enable existence of skilled people.
Agile Business Processes: Organizational business processes being agile is important for the success of digital transformation projects. In particular, the agility of such business processes determines the success of digital transformation initiatives. As per Markus and Tanis (2000), implementation of an enterprise system was a radical innovation that re-engineers the organizational business processes. Similarly, digital transformation processes can restructure business processes and develop a new organizational identity (Depaoli et al., 2020). Even though such radical changes are important, it is mandatory to manage such radical changes carefully. Especially for SMEs, managing the business processes carefully becomes one of the prime factors as most SMEs do not possess standard, consistent business processes existing in their organizations. Such irregularities may hinder the digital transformation projects in SMEs. However, agility in redeveloping the organizational business processes is key for success of digital transformation endeavors. This is evident in the COVID-19 pandemic where organization agility emerges as a key enabler in driving digital transformation in SMEs to counter the uncertain environment (Troise et al. 2022).
Organizational Culture: As per Wood (2001), organizational culture is defined as the systems of shared beliefs and values that develop within an organization or within its sub-units and that guides the behavior of its members. As per extant literature organizational culture is considered as one of the most important factors that establish the extent of innovation in organizations (Adams et al., 2006; Boudreau & Lakhani, 2013; Büschgens et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2016). This is especially true for SMEs as considering its size and the limited resources availability, it is very important for the managers to ensure positive innovation favoring culture in the organization. Such innovation-favoring environment will ensure the success of digital transformation projects as well. When considering SME context, commonly studied cultural dimensions like empowerment, collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance highlight positives of SMEs that enable digital transformation in the organization (Çakar & Ertürk, 2010). Organizational culture guides the organizational business processes as well as controls. As such, proper management and establishing enriching organizational culture will determine the success of digital transformation initiatives in SMEs.
External Enablers
Three external enablers (as displayed in Figure 3) were identified from the literature analysis that have key influence on driving the digital transformation in SMEs. While the authors acknowledge additional enablers such as governmental interventions, policies and rules as factors that may influence digital transformation in organizations, the findings are limited as the book chapter reports only the findings of the literature analysis sample. The details of each of the enablers are provided below.
  knowledge and capacity determine the success of digital transformation projects.

 Figure 3. External enablers for digital transformation in SMEs
Digital Technology: Nambisan (2013) identified digital technologies as new IT-based resources that include social media, mobile technologies, analytics, cloud computing, and internet-of-things. In the contemporary technology landscape, in addition to new changes to these existing technologies, new and advanced technologies are on the rise. For example, technologies such as robotics, nanotechnologies, blockchain and cognitive technologies are changing the very nature of how organizations conduct their businesses. Such changes are demanding organizations to be innovative and create a competitive business landscape. As such, digital technology becomes an external enabler that drives digital transformation initiatives. However, internally, SMEs need to consider the expertise and financial capacity to manage these technologies before investing in digital technologies for digital transformation initiatives. They also need to understand how to adapt and integrate digital technologies with business functions, so that they can leverage their competitiveness through digital transformation. While the innate characteristics of digital technologies such as cost efficiency, ease-of-use, ease-of-implementation favors SMEs, it is important to understand the market and establish a strategy that aligns with the organizational capacity.
Digital Competition: The advancement of social media and mobile technologies have changed the way organizations connect with their customers. The advent of these technologies has provided even micro- sized organizations with an opportunity to compete with the rest of the organizations. As such, in this modern day and age, there is extremely fierce competition among organizations. The price of the goods and services, the availability, delivery times of the goods and services no longer provide a competitive advantage for the organizations. As per the Darwinian law, the ‘digitally strongest’ organizations thrive and survive in this digital competition. With the capacities provided through social media, SMEs can understand market needs. The real-time feedback offered via such platforms enables SMEs to make changes to their products and services. Not only for obtaining feedback, but SMEs are also able to fiercely market their products and services via these channels. Previously, organizations were required to allocate an extensive budget for marketing and promotion. However, such initiatives have been competitive with the advent of digital technologies. Therefore, this is considered as an external driver for digital transformation initiatives in SMEs.
Digital Customer Behavior: The contemporary business landscape has changed immensely due to the advent of digital technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this situation and as a result, how organizations operate has changed as well. For example, before the pandemic, remote working was not a prominent concept. In addition, e-commerce was common, however, among SMEs this was not a popular
  
concept. For the survival of the SMEs, it was mandatory for them to have a digital presence and build customer agility (Troise et al. 2022). Customer agility is the extent to which a SME senses and responds to customer needs (Atapattu & Sedera, 2014). SMEs are in a better position to obtain knowledge regarding market opportunities when they utilize the feedback of customers and involve them in creating new ideas, products, and services. Such digital transformation initiatives were enforced due to digital customer behaviors. The advent of concepts such as doing business via social media sites, social media influencers have transformed the very nature of modern businesses. The lifestyles, routines, norms of the customers are invariably intertwined with digital technologies. As such, customer behaviors too, have changed due to these changes. As such, digital customer behavior is considered as an external driver of digital transformation among SMEs.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The objective of this book chapter was to understand the enablers of digital transformation in SMEs. To analyze this phenomenon, in this book chapter, the authors conducted a systematic review of 71 papers in multiple disciplines that discussed digital transformation in SMEs. The literature analysis allowed the revelation of internal and external enablers for digital transformation in SMEs. Specifically, internal factors such as facilitating organizational strategy, sustainable technology capabilities, flexible organizational controls, accessibility to partnerships, agile business processes, skilled people, and supportive organizational culture facilitate digital transformation in SMEs. External factors including available digital technologies, digital customer behavior, and digital competition are important considerations for SMEs in their digital transformation journey.
This research provides both theoretical and practical contributions to the field. Theoretically, this book chapter opens new pathways for researchers to better understand digital transformation in SMEs. While much research has been done to unpack the black box of digital transformation process in large organizations (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Selander & Jarvenpaa, 2016; Vial, 2019), limited insights have been provided on understanding digital transformation process in SMEs. The advent of digital technologies has offered SMEs the opportunity to initiate digital transformation in a similar fashion as large-sized organizations. SMEs with unique characteristics, however, warrant the need for a separate investigation. This study hence contributes by providing insights into digital transformation in SMEs through the identification of key enablers. Next, this study provides two frameworks to summarize these key enablers for facilitating digital transformation in SMEs. Such frameworks serve as the basis for future research to be tested and validated to provide empirical evidence. Practically, the findings of this study will be important for policy makers, and managers of SMEs to understand and determine the factors for facilitating successful digital transformation in SMEs. SMEs have been playing a key role in the national economy, a profound understanding of the digital transformation process in SMEs and its enablers will provide enormous benefits for SMEs to bring in digital technologies for their organizations.
There are certain limitations for this study. Since this research is at the conceptual level, empirical research is required to further establish the findings. For example, while there can be more new enablers of digital transformation in SMEs, the findings are limited to the existing studies. Future research can focus on validating the suggested enablers and thereby assisting SMEs to design effective digital strategies. Next, the authors acknowledge the size of the literature sample as the authors only considered journals for our analysis. Recent quality publications such as conference proceedings can be included in future research to extend the scope of the review and enrich the findings. In addition, there can be associations among the enablers. Such nuance associations can only be identified through an explorative study. The authors encourage future studies to be conducted on this line to contribute to both academia and practice.
