ABSTRACT
This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on Supply Chain Risk (SCR) research, focusing on
content-based analysis. The study comprehensively examines the general factors associated with key themes and
trends in supply chain risk management, encompassing the identification and assessment of risks, risk mitigation
strategies, and the influence of emerging technologies on Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). The review
provides an overview of current and emerging topics in SCRM, while also introducing categorization frameworks
to address research gaps and provide a roadmap for future studies, thereby generating valuable insights in this
field. The review highlights the significance of effective SCRM in ensuring business continuity and resilience,
emphasizing the need for organizations to adopt a proactive approach to risk management. The paper concludes
by identifying areas for future research, including the development of novel risk management frameworks and
the integration of emerging technologies into supply chain risk management practices. Additionally, a
comprehensive evaluation of each classification is presented, highlighting overlooked aspects and unexplored
domains, and offering recommendations for potential next steps in SCRM research.
1. Introduction
The process of detecting, analyzing, and managing the risks associated with the global and dispersed information and communications
technology structure is known as SCRM [1]. It is also the process of
discovering, analyzing, and reducing threats to the integrity, reliability,
and authenticity of goods and services along the supply chain [2]. A
practical approach to SCRM involves identifying and assessing known
and unknown risks, building a risk management framework, and
implementing strategies to mitigate risks [3].
The strategies for success in SCRM include diversifying suppliers,
building strong relationships with suppliers, monitoring supplier performance, and investing in technology to develop Supply Chain (SC)
visibility and resilience [4]. SCRM is a critical aspect of modern business
operations. Companies confront a wide range of risks as global SCs get
more complicated, threatening their capacity to offer products and
services to customers [5]. From natural disasters and geopolitical
instability to cyber-attacks and supplier bankruptcies, the risks are many
and varied. To effectively manage these risks, companies need to
comprehensively understand the key matters and emerging trends in
SCRM. This review will explore these issues in SCRM, providing insights
and recommendations for companies looking to enhance their risk
management capabilities [6].
A risk factor is "anything that increases the likelihood of developing a
disorder" [7]. Risk factors include age, family history, lifestyle choices,
and environmental variables. Age, a family record of particular malignancies, and exposure to specific chemicals are all risk factors for cancer
[8]. The term "risk factor" is used by epidemiologists to characterize
factors related to an elevated risk of illness or infection [9].
Several common risks in SCM can disrupt operations and cause significant financial losses. These risks are classified into four types: economic, environmental, political, and ethical [10]. Manufacturing risks,

storing and shipment risks, financial risks, legal risks, quality risks,
transit delays, theft, natural catastrophes, weather-related issues, and
cybercrime are some critical risks associated with SCM [11].
Inadequate project management, inadequate phrasing, or alterations
to the scope of work are all critical threats that might jeopardize the
timetable and have severe financial consequences. To mitigate these
risks, businesses can implement strategies such as diversifying suppliers,
building strong relationships with suppliers, monitoring supplier performance, investing in technology to improve SC visibility and resilience, and having contingency plans [12].
Emerging technologies are predicted to considerably impact SCRM.
Autonomous mobile robots, truck collaboration, and Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT) are some of the technologies expected to impact SCM
in the future. However, adopting these technologies also brings new
security risks that must be addressed [13].
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics are also key
technologies that can help improve supply chain management and
decision-making. Technology is essential for SCM experts to extract
concrete and practical details from data, and numerous SC executives
regard technology as an instrument of competitive advantage [14].
SCRM consists of identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks in the SC
[15]. The demand for SCRM has grown dramatically over the previous
decade, especially in the past five years, due to the proliferation of
global risks. SCRM allows government and industry to defend against
known threats to SCs while building resilience to future risks [16].
The Biden-Harris administration has revealed the results of a
comprehensive 100-day SC evaluation for four essential items, demonstrating various risks and vulnerabilities in US supply networks [17].
The study includes six suggestions for reinforcing critical supply networks and enhancing environmental guidelines [18]. There are several
ways to approach SCRM, including determining risk categories, assessing risks, and developing mitigation strategies [19]. The review also
identified several risk detection and mitigation strategies, including risk
pooling, supplier diversification, and inventory management [20]. Scientists created a theoretical structure for SC resiliency established on
vulnerabilities and capacities, highlighting SC risks [21]. A literature
review of SCRM identified four main categories of risk: demand, supply,
environmental, and operational [22].
The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the significance of SCRM.
The pandemic has affected supply chains worldwide, leading to significant disruptions [2,5,10,11,13]. A comprehensive framework for
SC-COVID-19 manifestations has been developed, considering nine
factors and 58 elements. Decision-makers and researchers can use the
framework, and it can be generalized to other industries [23]. The term
"Risk" is used in multiple ways, denoting uncertain variables that reduce
outcome predictability and the effects of those risks [24].
SCRM is described in the paper as recognizing and handling risks for
the SC by an integrated strategy across SC members to lessen overall SC
vulnerability [25]. Due to a growing complicated global network, which
can result in delays and quality issues in SC operations, SC uncertainty is
a big worry for managers. While overlooking various distinguished
factors contributing to risk and uncertainty, scholarship has concentrated on particular sources of uncertainty related to in-house
manufacturing processes, supply-side processes, and end-customer demand. In the present competitive economy with multiple newest challenges, enhanced comprehension of uncertainty and risk management is
still a significant issue [26] due to tremendous supply and demand
instability, globalization of markets, and shorter product and technology
lifespan cycles. In addition, the growing use of outsourced production,
distribution, and logistics creates intricate linkages in the global supply
chain, boosting risk exposure [27].
Managing SCRs, a crucial aspect of SCM, is commonly understood as
the probability that a hostile and unanticipated event will happen and
either directly or indirectly interrupt the SC [28]. The Indian Ocean
tsunami in 2004, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in
2011, and the fire at a Philips plant in New Mexico in 2000 (that
obstructed the SCs of Nokia and Ericsson, resulting in a monetary loss of
400 million Euros for Ericsson), an earthquake in Taiwan [29], recently
COVID-19 and earthquake in Turkey are just a few instances of unforeseen occurrences that demonstrate the detrimental effects of disruptions on organizational performance. The kind and characteristics of
unpredictable developments or the consequence of such actions are
challenging or impossible to forecast [30]. To mitigate and avoid risks,
scholars, and professionals agreed to manage risks [31]. Therefore,
SCRM strives to create plans for identifying, evaluating, managing, and
monitoring risks in SC [32]. As a result, professionals and researchers
are highly interested in various aspects of SCRM.
2. Background and related research
2.1. Related works
Considering this, researchers have discovered a variety of variables
that affect the connections between SCR, disruptions, resilience, and
performance [33]. Although the objective versus subjective aspect of
risk is still discussed, investigators agree that risk management should
be viewed as a process with three phases: risk identification, estimation,
and evaluation [34]. It is harder to define SCR and challenging to
categorize distinct types of SCR [35].
Abbasi et al., (2023) [110] designated the home healthcare SC
considering risk during COVID-19. Babu et al., (2023) [111] considered
a SC risk assessment for small and medium in post-COVID-19. Vafadarnikjoo et al., (2023) [112] researched a novel grey MO binary linear
programming model for risk assessment in SCM. Debnath et al., (2023)
[113] investigated sustainable supplier selection in the healthcare supply chains. Deretarla et al., (2023) [114] studied the SCM for assessments of the vendor selection area. Kabir et al., (2023) [115] analyzed
the risk assessment and decision-making in fuzzy systems.
To advance common cognition, scholars must know what has already
been accomplished, the advantages and disadvantages of current studies, and
their underlying significance [36].
Khalili-Damghani and Ghasemi (2016) [116] planned the SC model
in risk and fuzzy framework simultaneously. Ghasemi et al., (2017)
[117] designed the decentralized SC planning model considering risk.
Ahmadi Choukolaei et al., (2021) [118] analyzed the efficient crisis
management in Tehran with a risk approach. Ghasemi et al., (2022, c)
[123] considered the location-routing problem in the SC based on risk.
Shokouhifar et al., (2021) [119] designed the blood supply chain
considering risk with the fuzzy model. Safaei et al., (2022) [120]
designed a Closed-loop Supply Chain Network (CLSCN) by forecasting
risk management.
Ghasemi et al., (2022,a) [121] suggested the model for blood SC
focused on a risk problem robust optimization approach. Shokouhifar &
Ranjbarimesan (2022) [124] managed the supply chain network (SCN)
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the risk. Li et al., (2023)
[125] analyzed SCRM for the big data in disaster conditions. Fernando
et al., (2023) [126] consider SCRM with performance in the industry 4.0
era.
Abbasi’s (2023) [127] assessment of environmental impacts at risk
the COVID-19. The vaccine supply chain network (VSCN), proposed by
Abbasi et al. in 2023 [128], is considered environmental risk environmental risk into consideration. Ghasemi et al., (2022, b) [122] suggested
a new humanitarian relief logistic network in risk situations. Kamran,
et al., (2023) [129] designed the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Chain
Network (VSCN) under risk issues. Shokouhifar et al., (2023) [130]
considered the SCRM in Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC).
Existing literature reviews, as shown in Table 1, promote the
development of identification of possible risks in the SC process, better
categorization methods and models, and, as a result, a better comprehension of the problems involved in the study of SCRM. Table 1 details
the published review papers on SCRs.

quantitative models or specific industries (e.g., [30,38]. Moreover, most
of these papers—save for two—only evaluated a tiny number of publications. Given the focus area of interest, [44] evaluated 31 publications,
[27] examined 55 papers, and [45] investigated 55 articles. However,
the SCRM field is expanding so quickly that 658 articles have been
released since 2020 (Fig. 1). The studies that involved risk categories
and were published between 2020 and 2023 (801) were never reviewed,
as shown in Table 1. Additionally, as seen in Table 1, content-based
reviews after the pandemic were addressed by [78], [72], [71], and
[80], however except for [80], the authors have reviewed tiny numbers
of articles, and [80] concerned on the optimization models in SCRM, not
a holistically reviewed the papers. Again, none of these reviews has used
bibliometric analysis. As a result, it is stated that a new SLR on SCRM is
required.
Finally, we review the literature to identify potential SCRM gaps.
Numerous studies have also used data-driven methodologies or extensive data analysis in SCM and risk analysis. However, they either
concentrate solely on the internal operations of the SC, a single industry,
or assessments based on internal numerical data gathered from test
companies. In contrast, this study created a comprehensive risk classification backed by a sizable dataset that included existing literature until
2023. By classifying SCR categories, risk factors, and risk management
techniques, our work also suggests a new insight into SCRM. It provides
a comprehensive view since 1478 articles were included in the bibliometric analysis.
2.2. Research gap, novelty, and contribution
One contribution of this study is to offer a structure for the present
stage of research, which would be helpful to us as researchers. This review presents the past and current focuses on the SCR investigation and
offers a future direction.
The main contribution of this review paper is to answer the following
questions:
1. What are the most studied themes related to SCCR over the years?
2. How has the research on SCR evolved over the past years?
3. Which countries have been the most active in publishing research on
SCR?
4. What are the most frequently cited publications on SCR?
5. How has the emphasis on diverse types of SCR (e.g., operational,
financial, managerial) changed over time?
3. Research method and scope
3.1. Research method
In this research, a content-based Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
was performed. Although an SLR is often carried out manually and may
be time-consuming, the SLR procedure might be performed efficiently,
quickly, and evidence-based with novel information management instruments [46]. Combining in-depth qualitative methods with potent
quantitative analyses is a crucial benefit of content analysis. Flexible
investigations on two levels are made possible by this method: First,
reveal the subject matter of text and documents, and latter, unearth the
text’s hidden meaning and content [62]. On the other hand, the suggested systematic artificial-intelligent-based framework may produce
findings more quickly as it can quickly analyze a more extensive dataset.
A data-driven approach would produce results with less human bias
[81].
Due to various utilizing areas of bibliometric methods, such as organization, innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations management,
strategic management, there is a trend of using bibliometric and lexicographic techniques. The power of bibliometric analyses stands in their

unobtrusiveness and objectivity, allowing for a high level of quantifiability and quantitative analysis. The outcome depicts the core subjects
of research efforts with a conceptual structure based on the authors’
contributions to its intellectual advancement [82]. The most prevalent
bibliometric network approaches are co-citation and co-occurrence
analysis. A relationship between two articles arises in co-citation when
another work cites both. A core premise of co-citation is that the more
two publications are mentioned, the more probable their topics are
connected. Although co-citation analysis identifies leading documents,
developing trends, and other intriguing outcomes, it frequently fails to
accurately reflect the content of the study themes discussed in the
literature. In addition, it is less trustworthy and constrained by its search
approach to less referenced and the latest papers. In contrast,
co-occurrence analysis employs a set of common terms rather than
groups of shared citations. Co-occurrence analysis is the only bibliometric approach mapping relevant literature based on term encounters.
Co-occurrence analysis tacitly believes that a set of collected keywords
may reveal the root topics and that keyword co-occurrences can reveal
the relationship with those themes [61]. Hence, in this review, the
co-occurrence of keyword analysis was employed to detect the themes
related to SCR.
3.2. Search scope
Scopus and Web of Science are two of the most used search engines
accessible for discovering scholarly publications from various publishers
and periodicals. We utilized the Scopus search engine to perform our
literature inquiry since it is highly regarded and utilized for content
mapping and co-citation analysis. Compared to the Web of Science,
Scopus presents a database of documents most closely associated with
the research subject [71].
On 3rd May 2023, the search term SCR in article titles, keywords,
and abstracts yielded 2703 documents. We refined the articles written in
English and published them in peer-reviewed international journals
from review papers, conference documents, master and doctoral theses
and dissertations, textbooks, or book chapters, giving us 1498. We
further confined the source of these documents to journals that yielded
1478 articles. These articles were extracted as a CSV file with complete
information and uploaded into VOS-Viewer software to analyze.
We profited from bibliometric analysis, a scientific analytic method
to show data and information that uses mathematical and statistical
tools to identify study areas and hotspots and track trends in a subject.
VOS-viewer, developed by [83], is a widely used display tool for bibliometric analysis nowadays.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive statistics
This section gave summary statistics related to the articles in SCR.
Based on the 1478 articles were examined in terms of article count, as
shown in Fig. 1 below.
From an observational standpoint - taking the publishing years into
account - it is noteworthy to observe that the quantity of articles is rising
throughout the period (2015–2023), indicating that the subject is
expanding. The number of published articles was picked last year, and
801 articles were written in this area during and after COVID-19.
Because the topic’s potential is open to investigation, such theoretical, empirical, numerical, political, and strategical aspects were
handled by investigators across numerous disciplines. The distribution
of publications on various study fields is depicted in the pie chart in
Fig. 2 below. According to Fig. 2, researchers mainly focused on business
and management aspects of SCR, accounting for 29% of overall study
fields. The following explored areas are decision science and engineering, accounting for 17% of the total. The topic gained attention by
computer scientists appearing to rank third and social scientists fourth.
SCR was investigated by scholars in the fields 4% in economics,
econometrics, and finance, 3% in environmental science and mathematics, and 3% in Energy. The remaining disciplines in Fig. 2 constitute
approximately %1 of all areas, while the rest that is not illustrated in
Fig. 2 represents less than 1% of the total all domains.
The highly cited articles over the years in the SCR are demonstrated
in Table 2 below. [84]’s article, " Building the Resilient Supply Chain,”
published in 2004, was referenced by 1714 other papers.
More recently, Ivanov and friend’s articles (“Viability of intertwined
supply networks: extending the supply chain resilience angles towards
survivability. A position paper motivated by COVID-19 outbreak” and
“The impact of digital technology and Industry 4.0 on the ripple effect
and supply chain risk analytics” have gained attention by scholars and
cited by over 700 papers.
It is clear from Table 2 that the scholars are particularly interested in
resilience and risk mitigation studies and have recently focused on
digital solutions of SCR. Fig. 3 has mapped the top nations where writers
produced the most articles.
The United States has the most published articles in this field,
constituting approximately 17.5% of the total. China is the second most
creative country, accounting for around 10.8% of all papers published in
this field, followed by India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Australia, with articles 183, 156, 100, and 80, respectively. Iran, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brazil, and

Spain contributed around 3% of the total (10,468). The nations whose
number of articles is more than 30 are Iran (48), France(45),
Indonesia42, Malaysia (39), Canada (37), Italy (36), Brazil (35), Vietnam (33), Japan (32), Pakistan (32), Sweden (32), Thailand (32), and
Turkey (31).
Although this general visualization does not reflect the true number
of articles in total because different nations co-authored some papers,
further visualization is needed to uncover the most creative countries
and the collaboration between them.
Jermsitiyparsert, K. contributed to the SCR area mainly with 20 articles. Wagner, S.M., Gunasekaran, A., Ghadge, A., and Sawik, T. are
among the top creative authors with their contributions to the literature.
Of 159 journals, the top 25 that released articles in the SCRs are
listed in Table 3. The International Journal of Production Research is the
leading journal with 85 pieces, constituting approximately 7.59% of the
total articles. The International Journal of Production Economics was
the second most released paper in the field with 58 articles, followed by
the journals Supply Chain Management (3.48%), International Journal
of Logistics Management (3.21%), International Journal of Supply Chain
Management (2.86%), and Sustainability Switzerland (2.86%) contributing to the area respectively.
4.2. Bibliographic coupling analysis
Like co-citation, bibliographic coupling is a similarity metric that
establishes a connection between texts based on citation analysis. When
two works cite the same third work in their bibliographies, this is known
as bibliographic coupling. It is a sign that there is a chance the two works
deal with the same subject matter.
If two papers both cite one or more other documents, they are said to
be bibliographically connected. The more citations to other texts two
given documents have, the stronger their "coupling strength" is. The idea
of bibliographic coupling is shown in the image to the right. Bibliographic coupling may be helpful in a wide range of domains since it
enables researchers to locate similar work that has already been done.
However, if two papers are independently cited by one or more additional documents, they are said to be co-cited [115].
The classification of research articles according to the journal is too
broad or vague because each scientific journal is categorized into a
significant field, even though journals increasingly cover a more
comprehensive range of disciplines and paradigms. The bibliographic
coupling method determines how comparable the subject matter of the
two publications is. Bibliographic coupling is not subjectively helpful in
all domains of study since it assists investigators in locating previous
relevant research.
4.2.1. Co-authorship analysis
The link between the primary research aims to be shown in coauthorship. It contains authors, institutions, and national collaboration networks. VOSviewer visualization analysis of collaborating networks is presented in the next section from the perspectives of authors
and countries/regions.
Fig. 5 displays the co-authorship network diagram of 54 authors
because it is intended to illustrate the authors whose min article number
is 2 in the network diagram. The authors’ relationships were divided
into seven categories. The diameter of the nodes represents the number
of articles written by the author, and the link between any nodes symbolizes collaborations between two authors. That implies that the two
scientists joined by the line collaborated on at least one work.
Rajesh, R. has the greatest total connection strength (TCS= 24.61)
and published five articles in this area, followed by the co-authors Alora,
A. -Barua, M.K. with their TCS= 72.37. Ekwall, D. - Lantz, B. comes third
in terms of TCS (72.17). Although Sawik, T. has the most published
articles in this area, the TCS of Sawik is lower than the authors
mentioned above.
The thickness of the lines represents the level of collaboration among
particular two authors. Put another way, the thicker the lines, the more
publications they co-authored. The level of collaboration between
writers within groups is significantly greater than between authors from
distinct groups. For example, Sawik, T., Ivanov, D., and Tarei P.K.-
Thakkar, J.J. has more collaboration than others.
4.2.2. Co-authorship to countries
The threshold value, in this case, was set to 5, indicating that the

nations in the figure have at least five articles. This condition was
satisfied by 51 of the 92 countries/regions. The 51 countries were
grouped into different color groupings. The item-based density mapping
confirms that most leading country is the US, and China, India, the UK,
and Germany are among the top five countries in terms of publishing
papers in the field of SCR. Fig. 6 visualizes the co-authorship frequency
among countries and depicts that the US, China, India, and the UK have
high densities. The marks on the country density view are the same as
those on the visible item, and a single nation has a different hue based on
its density at the time. It denotes that the color of a mapping item is
decided by the number of countries relating to another country.
For further analysis, the Network diagram in Fig. 7a and the timebased overlay diagram in Fig. 7b were created by VOS-Viewer software. The primary node represents the US, followed by China and India.
The thickest line represents the most vigorous cooperation between
China and the US. It also demonstrates that the US has the most
remarkable connections to other nations. It is plausible to assume that
the level of collaboration within the nations and areas influences the
number of articles.
As seen in Fig. 7a, The US has a relationship with different countries
in terms of publishing scientific papers. The following countries coauthored the articles published in the US: the UK, Turkey, Iran, South
Korea, South Africa, Iran, and Denmark. China, Poland, Saudi Arabia,
and Tunisia have co-authorship in this field. In contrast, India has an
authorship- network with Jordan, New Zealand, and the United Arab
Emirates. The authors from Germany mainly published articles with the
researcher from mostly European countries, including Switzerland,
Netherlands, Greece, Brazil, and Belgium.
However, as seen in Fig. 7b, this co-authorship has changed over the
years, and recently, the authors expanded their network worldwide. For
example, the researchers from Turkey collaborated in this field with the
countries France, Norway, Iran, Australia, and others frequently. The
scientific conferences and scholarship programs might be the reason for
this shift.
4.2.3. Co-citation analysis
Co-citation analysis categorizes scientific literature into tiny publications that address specific issues. Co-citation coupling is a technique
for determining the subject similarity of two publications. When two
papers appear in a third document’s reference list, they are regarded to
Fig. 3. The number of papers published crossover the countries.
Fig. 4. The number of papers of authors.

Supply Chain Analytics 3 (2023) 100031

be co-cited. These writers have a co-citation connection. Papers A and B
may be considered connected if they are both cited by paper C, even if
they do not explicitly cite each other. Papers A and B have a stronger
association if referenced by several other papers [101]. It comprises a
co-citation network comprising cited references, cited sources, and cited
authors. The node size shows the number of citations; the line connecting the two points denotes a co-citation link between them. The
more publications that reference them, the stronger their association
becomes. The incidence with which two texts are jointly mentioned is
the co-citation occurrence.
A reference indicates that one author was affected by the published
work by a different author, but it does not usually specify the intensity or
direction of that effect. It is commonly considered that each reference
contributes equally to the citing article. Small’s (1973) study, which first
presented co-citation analysis, assesses the association between co-cited
papers with the premise that, more often, co-cited papers demonstrate
greater co-citation strength [102]. VOSviewer graphical visualization of
a co-citation network is displayed below from the authors’ perspective.
The co-citation connection of 192 authors whose citation is at least
100 is depicted in Fig. 8a. The author ties are color-coded into three
categories. The most central node represents Christopher, M., followed
by Ivanov, D. and Tang, C.S. The more citations there are, the bigger the
node. It means Christopher, M. has the most often referenced publications among these authors, followed by Ivanov, D. and Tang, C.S. As seen
in Fig. 8b, the path connecting Ivanov, D. and Dolgui, A. has the thickest
weight (TCS=86.46), followed by Sokolov, B. and Ivanov, D.
(TCS=57.35). It denotes the strength of their co-citations. That is,
Ivanov, D., and Dolgui are referenced 86.46 times they are referenced
together.
4.2.4. Co-citation of references
Co-citation to references depicts the connection of objects by
counting how many times they are referenced together. The main understanding of the study topic may be retrieved effectively and readily
from the multitude of referenced references using co-citation analysis.
Additionally, the significance of publications can be examined and
mined. Papers having more than 100 citations of a cited reference were
evaluated with VOS viewer, and 4 references are presented in Fig. 9.
These four papers have six connections between the group and the TCS is
174.50. Tang, C.S.’s article titled “Perspectives in supply chain risk
management” has the greatest TCS (104), followed by the paper titled
“Managing disruption risks in supply chains” by Kleindorfer, Pl and Saad
G., H., with a TCS of 90 times.
4.2.5. Co-occurrence analysis
Occurrences. When working with keywords, the Occurrences property specifies how many documents include a term. The definition of the
occurrences property when dealing with words is determined by the
counting technique selected in the VOSviewer. The occurrences property in binary counting represents the number of papers in which a
phrase emerges at least once. The occurrences property in complete
counting specifies a phrase’s total number of occurrences in all
documents.
4.2.5.1. Co-occurrence to authors’ keywords. Co-occurrence to Authors’
keywords is a bibliometric study that shows the frequency of keywords
or phrases occurring in papers at the same time. Correlation is computed
at the paper level in this study. The correlation shows the frequency with
which two keywords appear together in a paper [72]. The stronger the
connection between two terms, the higher their co-occurrence
frequency.
The power of connection is high within members of a shared cluster
but low amongst components of distinct clusters. The minimum number
of keyword co-occurrences was set to 10 for analysis. The requirement
was met by 78 of the 3343 keywords. VOS viewer program computed the
connection degree of the co-occurrence relationship with other phrases
or keywords for each of the 78 terms. The graphic was created with the
highest total connection power, and 78 keywords were color-coded and
grouped into ten categories. Fig. 10 depicts the network analysis diagram based on the authors’ keywords. "supply chain risk management,"
"supply chain risk," "risk management”, “supply chain," “risk mitigation,”, “agility,”, “supply chain disruption,” and “logistics” were the
most frequently appeared keywords and listed with the highest TCS.
4.2.5.2. Co-occurrence of terms in abstracts and titles. The co-occurrence
of items in various documents can be determined through the analysis of
relatedness. This type of analysis can be useful in identifying popular
topics and trends in scientific research, leading to better monitoring and
follow-up.
The condition was set to analyze the relevancy of terms in abstracts
and titles of articles so that a term appeared at least 10 times in all articles. Of the 25,751 terms, 761 satisfied the condition. 60% (457) were
selected for the terms’ relevancy score calculation as a default value.
VOSviewer created five clusters with the colors red, green, blue, yellow,
and purple that are shown in the network diagram in Fig. 11. From 457
items, some phrases irrelevant to the contents of articles, such as “future
direction, ”future study”, “current study,” “proposal,” “research gap,”
and others, were excluded from the list, and for the remained 391 items,
VOSviewer provides a time-based visualization of terms called the
Overlay Diagram, as depicted in Fig. 12.
Each cluster has different terms or phrases related to a similar theme.
Although all phrases in each cluster have been given as an Appendix, the

model for dealing with risks in firms’ SCM. The conceptual framework is
based on five main dimensions, as illustrated in Fig. 13. To mitigate
SCRs, the firms should be at a maturity level of the following dimensions: the firm’s competitiveness level, operational responsiveness
level, decision-making capability level, monitoring capability level, and
standardization for sustainability.
5.1. Firm’s competitiveness level
In the following subsections, these dimensions are explained. Due to
globalization, offshore, and outsourcing growth, the consciousness of
risks within SCs has increased as more stakeholders are engaged.
Because of the inherent linkages, which can result in problems on both
the supply and demand sides, globalization encourages risks in SCs [36].
Many organizations overlook critical risks in their SCs, leading to significant problems. Recent events have highlighted the vulnerabilities

Supply Chain Analytics 3 (2023) 100031

present in today’s complex SCs. Despite this, a systematic and structured
approach to conceptualizing vulnerabilities and SCRs has only recently
emerged [25]. Scientists and managers use vulnerability and disruption
to characterize a risk-affected supply chain.
Vulnerability is an encounter with disruptions caused by SCRs that
impair the capacity to satisfy the demands of the end customer market
[66]. Due to their limited resources, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable to SC disruptions, severely affecting
their financial performance, competitive advantage, and survival.
However, the lack of knowledge and the absence of a theoretical foundation limit the development of SCRM practice in SMEs, especially for
policymakers, SC professionals, and practitioners.
It was argued that organizations’ main reasons for using risk management strategies are increased global rivalry, technological development, and the constant pursuit of competitive advantage. Similarly,
more risks were present in the SCRM and performance chain context,
and new strategies were required to manage them. The need to provide
acceptable performance measurements and metrics to assess, inform,
and guide operational and strategic choices underlies these advancements in SCRM [39]. That means SC resilience and agility are a foundation for competitive advantage, as they provide flexibility,
responsiveness, and adaptability in an uncertain business environment.
Resilience refers to an organization’s ability to swiftly return to an
original working condition following a disruption, i.e., the ability to
’’bounce back from hardship’’. This behavior is analogous to an elastic
material under extreme pressure. The phrase will be considered equivalent to agile at the same time, to express the essential word of flexibility
represented by resilient [35].
Agility is one of the most successful paths to design a resilient SC
since it evaluates the ability to respond swiftly to changing situations.
Agility effectively changes operating states to respond to external uncertainty or market volatility. A corporation may adapt quickly to
market shifts and anticipated SC disruptions by planning for agility, a
risk management technique [29].
SC managers and account executives are two managers tmainly
influenced by the developments. Both roles are growing in strategic
relevance and are becoming more engaged in the development of interorganizational value and relationship management. The responsibilities
of SC managers are changing from functional to tactical. Their primary
concerns, including operational tasks such as contract generation,
negotiating, complying with contracts, expediting, planning, and
scheduling, have evolved dramatically over the last decade, frequently
through diverse standardization and automation. Still, SC experts have
also been increasingly engaged in strategic decision-making in complete
life cycle management, most notably proactively extending into the
design process and adopting collaborative innovation approaches in
solving issues and risk mitigation inside the SC [103].
Research into the antecedents of SC resilience has shown that factors
such as trust, information sharing, and culture play a vital role in
building a resilient SC. Furthermore, it has been suggested that SC agility
is an enabler of resilience and can significantly impact firm
performance.
Organizational culture is vital for successful SCM. Employee attitudes toward information sharing, cooperation, and risk-taking are
influenced by organizational culture. Trust and interpersonal interactions in the workplace enhance company culture. In the lack of
excellent corporate culture, achieving objectives might be challenging
[104]. An awareness of the underlying corporate cultural features,
strategic goals, and behavioral habits is required to design SC information infrastructures effectively. According to Roh etal., (2008) [105], the
organizational culture of a chief or primary firm impacts suppliers and
distributors in the same SC. The integration of external partners and the
alignment of the SCRM practice with the business strategy are critical
enablers to enhance SC performance.
5.2. Operational responsiveness level
The COVID-19 outbreak has wreaked havoc on the global SC
network. As a result, the cost of goods has increased, demand has fluctuated, and SCs have been put under immense strain. The pandemic has
increased demand for certain products, such as personal protective
equipment, while other products have experienced a decrease in order.
It has resulted in a raw material shortage, further exacerbating the
problem. The disruption risk has also increased, with many SC members
needing help maintaining their operations due to delays and availability
constraints. To diminish the influence of the pandemic, SC practitioners
have implemented various strategies such as postponement, safety
stock, and order allocation. However, these strategies require a trade-off
between cost and reliability, as increasing safety stock or postponing
production can increase the total cost of the SC.
The pandemic has reminded the importance of preparedness for such
disasters. SC practitioners and investors have had lessons from the
outbreak to optimize their SC network and improve their profitability in
the long term. Many scholars focus on the critical areas of SCM affected
by the pandemic, such as SC design, inventory management, demand
uncertainty, and SC cost.
SC disruption is commonly operationalized through self-reported
impact on six cross-functional metrics: prices, operational efficiency,
quality, responsiveness, reliability, and sales. This measure should
continue to be used, as it provides a parsimonious and holistic measure
of results.
The frequency of recurrence has been quantified on a rating system

that spans zero to regular, although temporal assessments might be more
objective. Safety inventory is a crucial buffering approach, and future
research should use more objective criteria to allow for cross-study
comparability. Most research projects are conducted from the standpoint of the focus company, but a more nuanced measure of the SC
network perspective is essential. SC resilience is a necessary construct,
but there is no agreement on how to define it. Longitudinal studies are
necessary to understand how SCRM evolves and how firms learn and
adapt in response to disruptions [75].
In this context, firms’ SC partners must acquire competencies to
protect their operations in case of an interruption.
The risks that cause problems companies experience due to poor
coordination or contract with vendors. Hence, the researcher proposed
new contract designs that ensure risk and revenue sharing with vendors.
The pricing strategy is one of the critical factors that play in contracting.
For example, due to credit risk, many companies become disadvantaged.
Some studies, therefore, utilized game theory or the Stackelberg game.
Game theory has been employed in advanced food and agricultural
research, such as examining various coordination techniques between
farmers and retailers under production and demand uncertainty [106].
On the other hand, others have proposed dynamic modeling to better
control inventory and production. [63] discovered a few methods for
this purpose, including missing the target MtT, mean-variance, exponential function utility, and value at risk.
Value-at-Risk (VAR) originating from the financial services business
is a statistical measure of risk. It was initially designed to analyze the risk
of an economic portfolio, and it is increasingly used to examine different
hazards that a company faces. VAR’s power to give a uniform gauge for
assessing and controlling risks throughout the company is one of its
primary capabilities. It estimates the maximum amount a business may
anticipate losing on an investment over a particular time at a given
confidence level in dollars or any currency [37].
The review article by [35] explores different mathematical models
used in SCRM. It discusses the application of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and
Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to single-echelon and multi-echelon
inventory management problems. The study examines research investigating risk analysis payment delays and various SC contracts, such as
SC discount contracts, wholesale pricing contracts, and returns policies.
The article also highlights the issue of information asymmetry in SCM
and how it has become a hot topic in the last decade, with various
studies exploring the ideal contractual structure under information
asymmetry.
When each SC partner places their order separately in a situation
where consumer demand follows an AR (1) process, it has been
demonstrated that this locally optimum ordering choice would produce
the ’’bullwhip’’ effect, which creates operational inefficiencies. On the
other hand, when consumer demand is a predictable and decreasing
function of the retail cost, each SC partner gives their ordering choice by
maximizing their profit for the case; it turns out that these locally
optimal choices lead to lower overall earnings for the whole SC.
Recently, there has been a surge in curiosity in SC contract analysis to
increase efficiency in operations or SC coordination. Usually, supply
contract concepts assume an SC with a single manufacturer (supplier)
and one retailer (buyer) who must meet consumer demand [38].
Heuristic, Multi-Objective (MO), Multi-Integer-linear Programing
(MILP), Multi-Integer-Programing (MIP), Linear Programing (LP),
Lagrangian Relaxation (LR), Genetic Algorithm (GA), probabilistic and
stochastic programming, and Monte Carlo Simulation are primarily
employed in mathematical methods.
Suryawanshi and Dutta (2022) [80] demonstrated that the scholars
who used techniques in SCRM are in this way: 44% for MILP and MINLP,
18% for LR, 10% for MCDM, 8% for Analytical, 8% for Simulation, in the
literature.
In the literature, various risk mitigation strategies exist for SCM,
including postponement and flexibility. Product development, production, and logistical postponement are all examples of postponement
techniques, while flexibility strategies contain flexible pricing, supply,
and contractual strategy. Possible responses include resource flexibility
systems and run-out reaction activities. Finally, a stochastic multiobjective mixed integer programming approach has been proposed to
establish optimal workflows for a multinational corporation doing
business in several countries [47].
5.3. Decision-making capability level
SCR assessment involves the identification of potential risk sources
and competition among alternative SC partners. Choosing suppliers is
crucial to a company’s ability to control SCRs. The critical issue of today’s managers is locating ideal suppliers who will provide the right
items at the correct spot at the right price and at the right time. The
product must also be supplied in the proper quantity, with the appropriate information, and, most importantly, with a minor interruption.
Therefore, when choosing suppliers, businesses should consider all
facets of a candidate’s performance, including price, product quality,
quantity, and service, and associated risks, including uncertainty,
vulnerability, and potential supply disruption [63].
In the automotive industry, SCRM is a critical issue due to the variety
of components and suppliers involved. Failure in any part of the SC
system can result in significant losses for the entire industry. The
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS),
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Multi-Criteria Decision
Making (MCDM), and Monte Carlo simulation are quantitative methods
for sustainable SC ranking and criticality analysis in the automotive and
pharmaceutical industries.
Identifying and quantifying critical risks and involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process is essential for the stability and
success of the SC system. The accuracy and validity of the risk analysis
are pressing issues that need to be addressed to find the ideal solution for
sustainable SCM.
Sustainable supplier selection.
5.4. Monitoring capability level
Crises can arise from multiple factors, such as natural disasters,
conflicts, or technological interruptions. On the other hand, data falsification, supply chain fraud, counterfeit manufacturing, digital security
threats, intellectual property theft, and contract violations are examples
of how malicious risks can manifest. According to the report, 33% of fish
samples had erroneous labels, and SC fraud has been called the "single
most exposed area" of fraud. Counterfeit manufacturing has also become
a significant issue in the automotive SC [28]. These are inevitable and
can have far-reaching effects on society, the economy, and the
environment.
Logistics and SCM play an essential role in the food industry to
ensure the supply of safe, healthy, and nutritious food. Due to the
perishable nature of agri-food, there is a high risk of damage from the
farmer to the consumer. The agri-food SC is also unique and is classified
into two categories: fresh agri-food and non-perishable agri-food. The
transportation of food is also critical to maintaining food safety and
quality, as controlling the temperature will reduce microbial growth in
food. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has established
guidelines for risk classification of food and food businesses to improve
food safety by enhancing food inspection systems. However, risk cannot
be eliminated but mitigated through a proactive approach [107].
Collaborative disruption risk management is essential to reduce
risks, improve disruptions, and achieve responsiveness and high
customer service. Because they provide capabilities like information
sharing, customer sensitivity, and process integration, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) tools are essential for achieving
collaborative perception [108].
Greater adaptability to cost fluctuation might be attained through
more intelligent cost-control approaches and collaborative risk

Supply Chain Analytics 3 (2023) 100031
17
management along the entire supply chain; consumer feedback should
permeate the SC through more profound customer experiences, and the
global SC should be intelligently incorporated and optimized.
In particular, intelligent manufacturing may be a crucial strategy for
implementing more competent SCM. Manufacturing, engineering, the
usage of materials, the SC, and life cycle management were all entirely
redesigned by Industry 4.0 [70].
Big data analytics, machine learning, drones, the Internet of Things,
advanced robotics, the sharing economy, cloud computing, 3D printing,
and blockchain are just a few of the nine cutting-edge technologies it
incorporates and heavily uses SSCM [70].
However, digital security is a problem that must be addressed in the
"Digital Dimension" to attain supply chain intelligence. The digitization
process’s governance will determine the future direction of supply
chains. As a result, the risks covered by SSCM are heavily focused on
events involving Information Technology (IT) and data security. Digital
security has lately concentrated on safeguarding corporate information,
resolving network issues, and coordinating and integrating operational
technology. Another significant cyber problem for the supply chain
community is the slight growth in the number of gateways handled by
cloud-based and Internet of Things (IoT) systems [70].
Conventional IT lacks real-time adaptation and concentrates on
dyadic settings of cooperation, and supply chain process reconfiguration
can be rigid and expensive to maintain. Adopting multi-agent modeling,
a branch of AI, may be a practical tool for making decisions in supply
chains. These agents might communicate and work together inside and
across enterprises, enabling the automatic real-time correction of SC
operations [108].
As a rapidly growing nation, India depends on its power and energy
sectors for growth and development.
In such a scenario, interdependency between various sectors becomes crucial, and modeling the same can help in standardizing the
monitoring of the system.
The role of blockchain technology, regulatory discipline, and safety
measures ensure transparency and traceability in the SC, with specific
reference to the food industry.
5.5. Standardization for Sustainability
The Takata airbag recall, the Volkswagen emissions scandal, and the
horsemeat scandal are just a few instances that illustrate the dangers of
malicious behavior in SCs. Each time, the businesses engaged in
dishonest behavior that negatively impacted every link in the SC.
The success of any business depends mainly on its SCM. With the
increasing complexity of global trade, SCRs have become a significant
concern for companies worldwide.
Classification is another critical factor in mitigating SCRs. By classifying suppliers based on their level of risk, companies can prioritize
their risk management efforts. This can be done by analyzing the supplier’s financial stability, reputation, and compliance with regulations.
Reference patterns are another useful tool in risk management. By
analyzing historical data, companies can identify patterns in supplier
performance, transportation delays, and other risk factors. This information can be used to develop proactive measures to prevent future
disruptions.
Regular inspections can help identify potential risks and prevent
disruptions before they occur.
The creation of a robust transport network is also critical in mitigating SCRs. Companies should have multiple transportation options,
including air, sea, and land transport, to ensure that they can quickly
adapt to changing market conditions and disruptions.
6. Conclusions, limitations, and direction for future
implications
6.1. Finding and discussing
This paper examined the recent state of investigations on SCM. The
review aimed to present the current state of SCRM studies, identify holes
in the literature, and underline emergent areas requiring more investigation. In an unpredictable and competitive corporate climate, the review investigates several risk concerns in SCM. It provides a thorough
and organized examination of the SCRM literature to offer a complete
grasp of the subject. The scope of the evaluation includes risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring. It also emphasizes the
need for SC partners to cooperate and exchange information to successfully manage risks. The review concludes by identifying rising topics
including the use of technology, big data analytics, and blockchain in
SCRM.
This paper identifies three categories of risk sources in SCs: environmental, network-related, and organizational, and highlights risk
drivers and risk-mitigating strategies, including avoidance, control,
cooperation, and flexibility. According to them, SCRM involves comprehending risk assessment, recognizing the SC’s risk theme, identifying
risk drivers, and managing risks in the SC. Developing AI risk management models can improve SC competence in the new dynamic and
business environment.
Further investigations are necessary to fully understand risk and its
SCM. There is a need to explore how organizations manage SCRs,
including the processes and techniques used to define and analyze SCRs,
how firms benchmark their SCR processes, and how companies evaluate
their SCR profile and develop risk contingencies. In conclusion, managing SCR should be an essential activity for most organizations, and to
understand this, a three-pronged research agenda is vital involving the
study of risk, in-depth empirical research, and the creation of solid and
well-founded risk management systems that include risk management
tools and approaches from different academic areas.
Integrating Machine Learning (ML) into SCRM has provided
numerous benefits, including increased flexibility and response time,
higher reliability and precision, and integration of new data sources.
However, there needs to be more research in practical use cases and
guidance for companies on integrating ML into SCRM. The integration of
ML also necessitates innovative assessment principles and changes to the
qualification requirements for SCR managers. While ML can improve
decision-making and mitigate potential biases, it also requires high
initial investments and legal issues regarding data collection and usage
for risk management. More detailed use cases and empirical studies are
needed to better understand ML’s positive effect on SCRM [76].
According to Cunha et al., (2019) [109], The majority of businesses
lack an established SCRM and mitigation framework. Some research
defines sustainability risks and develops a realistic management model
for SCRs connected to sustainability. The distribution of risk in
public-private collaborations is also discussed. The articles are focused
on recognizing the social hazards that firms face. The two most common
repercussions in the sample of articles are reputational harm and
financial losses. The framework understands that stakeholders will
respond if a social risk scenario exists in an organization’s SC, resulting
in implications for the enterprise. According to the concept, controlling
a company’s social risks can begin with determining its stakeholders and
the process that results from already outlined social hazards. In
conclusion, this study contributed to the current literature by proposing
a conceptual frame highlighting the SCRM’s vital role in enhancing SC
performance. The framework provides a theoretical foundation for
policymakers, SC professionals, and practitioners to develop and
implement effective SCRM strategies to build a resilient and agile SC.
In conclusion, effective SCRM is crucial for firms to maintain
competitiveness and achieve long-term success in today’s globalized and
complex business environment. The literature has highlighted various
A. Emrouznejad et al. 
Supply Chain Analytics 3 (2023) 100031
18
factors that impact the level of SCRs, such as globalization, operational
responsiveness, decision-making capability, and monitoring capability.
It has also emphasized the importance of developing resilient and agile
SCs through trust, information sharing, and culture. However, there are
still limitations in the literature, such as the lack of a theoretical foundation for SCRM practice in SMEs and the absence of a consensus on how
to define SC resilience. Future research should focus on developing
standardized guidelines for sustainable SCM, exploring emerging technologies’ impact on risk management and transport logistics, and
investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of using drones to mitigate
SCRs. Overall, the key is for companies to prioritize risk management
and proactively assess and mitigate potential disruptions to maintain
stable and efficient SCs.
6.2. Limitations and future implications
The limitation is that due to the VOSviewer nature, we could not
change plural terms into the singular form, nor did we standardize
identical phrases like ’resilient,’ ’resiliency,’ and resilience,’ which
could bring about a decreased value of the phrases that convey the
actual study term and thus affect the reliability of network clustering
[61].
The study has some research limitations and social implications.
Furthermore, the study is limited to SMEs, and future research could
explore the impact of SCRM on large companies.
The existing literature on SCRM has been reviewed in several studies.
Future research in this area could focus on emerging topics such as the
impact of new technologies on SCRM, the role of social and environmental risks, and the integration of risk management into SC sustainability efforts. Additionally, there is a need for more empirical research
to validate existing frameworks and models and to explore the effectiveness of different risk management strategies in different contexts.
