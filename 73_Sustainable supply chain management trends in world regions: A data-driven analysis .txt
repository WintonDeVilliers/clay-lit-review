ABSTRACT
This study proposes a data-driven analysis that describes the overall situation and reveals the factors hindering
improvement in the sustainable supply chain management field. The literature has presented a summary of the
evolution of sustainable supply chain management across attributes. Prior studies have evaluated different parts
of the supply chain as independent entities. An integrated systematic assessment is absent in the extant literature
and makes it necessary to identify potential opportunities for research direction. A hybrid of data-driven analysis,
the fuzzy Delphi method, the entropy weight method and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory
is adopted to address uncertainty and complexity. This study contributes to locating the boundary of fundamental knowledge to advance future research and support practical execution. Valuable direction is provided by
reviewing the existing literature to identify the critical indicators that need further examination. The results
show that big data, closed-loop supply chains, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and supply chain network
design are the most important indicators of future trends and disputes. The challenges and gaps among different
geographical regions is offered that provides both a local viewpoint and a state-of-the-art advanced sustainable
supply chain management assessment.
1. Introduction
Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has grown significantly and has become a subject of increased concern due to environmental resource limitations, a global population explosion, the
corruption of logistics production and consumption activities, and waste
and pollution increases (Rebs et al., 2019). Over the last decade, academics and practitioners have endeavored to expand the frontier of
sustainable development into supply chain management (SCM) to
investigate SSCM (Bui et al., 2021; Tseng et al., 2016; Tseng and Chiu,
2013). The progression of exploration into sustainability has resulted in
an increased emphasis on understanding various aspects of the
sustainable supply chain (Brandenburg et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2020;
Rajeev et al., 2017). As a result, the literal concept of SSCM is
wide-ranging and varied and needs to be explored as a whole together
with different viewpoints (Ansari and Kant, 2017). Integrated perception
approaches are required to address firms’ internal operations along with
their external upstream and downstream operations while also considering the potential diverging opinions regarding the overall benefits.
The literatures have presented summaries of the SSCM evolution
across different aspects (Rajeev et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2019;
Mohammed et al., 2020). For Instance, Gomez-Luciano ´ et al. (2018)
linked supply markets and globalization based on the theoretical foundation of SSCM and the related literature. Ciccullo et al. (2018)

addressed the integration of the lean, agile and SSCM paradigms with
sustainable environmental and social dimensions. Bastas and Liyanage
(2018) adopted an interorganizational view to study the state of the art
of sustainable supply chain quality management. Meherishi et al. (2019)
provided a better understanding of sustainable packaging in SCM in the
circular economy through a systematic approach. Wang et al. (2019)
categorized the research on precast SCM for off-site construction.
Rajeev et al. (2019) delineated the SSCM trends across theoretical angles
over various stages of economic growth. Prior studies have yet to
distinguish different parts of the supply chain as independent entities,
treating them instead with conventional imprecise consideration (K.
Govindan et al., 2020; Ni and Sun, 2019). A comprehensive integrated
assessment of SSCM is still absent in the extant literature, making it
necessary to identify potential opportunities for new study directions
(Ansari and Kant, 2017; Farooque et al., 2019). This study proposes a
data-driven analysis to illustrate a clear overall concept of SSCM and
reveals factors hindering improvement of the field.
SSCM helps to link development and environmental issues and drives
political and economic change locally, nationally and globally (Bui et al.,
2020b; Mangla et al., 2017). Sustainable practices must focus on local
social development and interconnected environmental issues as well as
on global economic consequences (Bendul et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2016).
Grimm et al. (2014) and Wu and Pullman (2015) argued that environmental and social corollaries regularly depend on the production site and
cultural elements, causing prospects to deviate among supply chain
partners. Ciccullo et al. (2018) claimed that the geographical concentration of the supply base improves operational performance due to
integration within the sustainable supply chain paradigm. Firms may
lack prominence in the supply base beyond the primary tier of their
supply chain partner; others may view them as sites where environmental
and existing execution is uncertain. The supply chain is characterized as
complicated, composed of different players, and detached across various
levels and different geographies; thus, the distinction between different
areas poses serious challenges to sustainability (Carter et al., 2015;
Koberg and Longoni, 2018). An emphasis on setting aside an overall
viewpoint to explore the regional phenomena of state-of-the-art SSCM is
necessary. This study has the following the aims as follows:
• To identify data-driven indicators for future trends and debates
• To determine the challenges and knowledge gaps among geographical regions
This study contributes to identifying the boundary of fundamental
SSCM knowledge to advance future studies and support practical
execution. Valuable direction is provided by the existing data-driven
literature and identifying the critical indicators needed for further examination. The challenges and gaps among different geographical regions are addressed not only to provide a local standpoint for advanced
assessment but also to comprehensively capture the global SSCM stateof-the-art. Since the supply chain environment has suffered uncertainties due to the urgent need to endorse sustainable development
and create competitive advantages (Tseng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a).
This study employs both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A
hybrid approach combining data-driven analysis, the fuzzy Delphi
method (FDM), the entropy weight method (EWM) and the fuzzy
decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is adopted
due to the uncertainty and complexity of SSCM. The VOSviewer is
applied to identify the SSCM indicators based on the big data in the
Scopus database (Shukla et al., 2019). The FDM is used to refine the
valid indicators by computing their perception levels from experts’
linguistic references (Bui et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020; Tseng and Bui,
2017). The EWM is to convert the indicator occurrence information into
comparable weights to determine the indicators’ performance among
regions; and the FDEMATEL identifies the perceptions through linguistic
preferences and the important indicators that require urgent attention in
future research to improve SSCM (Tseng, 2017; Tseng et al., 2018a).
The rest of this study is arranged into five sections. The next section
discusses the related literature on SSCM. The data collection process,
methodologies, and proposed analysis steps are reviewed in the third
section. The fourth section presents the results. Then, the study trends,
future challenges and regional implications are addressed in the fifth
section. The last section remarks upon the conclusions and limitations of
this study and provides suggestions for future studies.
2. Literature review
This section presents the related literature on SSCM from a regional
perspective.
2.1. Sustainable supply chain management
Seuring and Muller (2008) defined SSCM as managing the flow of
materials, information and capital as well as cooperation and collaboration among firms within the supply chain while adopting all the sustainable development goals entailed by the economic, environmental,
and social aspects (the triple bottom line; TBL) expectations of stakeholders and customers. Carter and Rogers (2008) describe SSCM as the
strategic, transparent, and complete integration of the TBL in the systematic coordination of business processes to improve the long-term
relationship between organizations and their supply chain. Ahi and
Searcy (2015) defined SSCM as the design of coordinated supply chains
including voluntary TBL integration to effectively and efficiently
manage product or service acquisition, manufacture, and distribution to
meet the requirements of stakeholders and improve the organization’s
profitability, resilience, and competitiveness in the short and long term.
Many classifications have been proposed. Türkay et al. (2016) proposed integrating dimensions of sustainability in supply chain design
and organization to comprehensively assess supply chain sustainability
strategies. Franco (2017) identified the challenges faced by supply chain
participants from product design to the recovery and reprocessing of
products in circular production. Golev and Corder (2017) performed an
in-depth examination of the sustainable supply chain associated with
e-waste management in the production chain. Liu et al. (2018) highlighted the significance of collaboration with different third parties at
distinct stages of supplier resourcefulness. The external and internal
sustainable supply chain perspectives are considered related viewpoints
in which tensions arising from inequitably distributed benefits are
apparent (Rebs et al., 2018). The SSCM literature reiterates that information flow, collaboration, coordination, and connectivity across the
supply chain network are key to achieving a higher level of organizational and supply chain sustainability performance (Liebetruth, 2017;
Rajeev et al., 2017; Reefke and Sundaram, 2016). Few contributions
cover both environmental and social influences, since focusing on the
economic scope is part of the conventional supply chain archetype
(Feng et al., 2017; Ciccullo et al., 2018).
In this context, environmental supply chains, green supply chains, and
closed-loop supply chains have been presented and used interchangeably
to extend the integration concepts of SSCM (Gurtu et al., 2015; Govindan
et al., 2015; Leszczynska and Maryniak, 2017). Shaharudin et al. (2019a)
identify past, present and future research developments for low-carbon
SCM. Tseng et al. (2019) reviewed green SCM to present insights and
directions for future investigation. Jia et al. (2020) established fundamental premises, tendencies and new paths for exploration through a
structured systematic review of sustainable supply chain finance motivations, accomplishments and performance. SSCM is essentially the effort
to integrate sustainable development into supply chain monitoring.
Incorporating sustainability concepts into principal business areas enables the organization to achieve competitive advantages, especially
given the dynamics of the global environment (Khodakarami et al., 2015).
Although the concept of SSCM has risen to prominence in recent decades
in response to growing challenges, the implications are that focusing on
progression and competences in the supply chain is not sufficient for an
F.M. Tsai et al.

organization to gain an advantageous position in the market (Ansari and
Kant, 2017). Firms are facing serious threats to the sustainability of their
existing supply chains due to globalization, uncertain demand, challenging markets, and pecuniary effectiveness (Roy et al., 2018). The
literature on SSCM has expanded; nevertheless, guidance for scholars and
future research opportunities are needed.
2.2. Sustainable supply chain management among regions
SSCM offers opportunities for regions to improve their ecological and
social performance as well as their competitiveness and to achieve
business goals (McMurray et al., 2014; van Hoof and Thiell, 2015).
Silvestre et al. (2018) stated that the supply chain consists of various
participants in different geographical regions; for example, manufacturers are usually located in developing countries. Ciccullo et al. (2018)
indicated that suppliers’ proximity concentrates the geographical supply
base, reduces supply lead time, and facilitates suppliers’ relationships
and deliveries. Mancheri et al. (2019) claimed that the supply chain’s
complexity and resilience are not reliant on physical disruptions alone
but also on dynamic factors such as societal and geopolitical factors.
Thus, it is important to confirm that regional issues are one of the key
elements influencing global SSCM because they drive global relevance.
Prior studies do not adequately address this specific issue (Fahimnia
et al., 2015; Khalid et al., 2015). Bendul et al. (2017) debated whether
sustainable development and the SCM relationship not only relate to
broader interconnected environmental issues with global consequences
but also express local community development. Vasquez ´ et al. (2019)
argued that a lack of adequate infrastructure among regions is a major
barrier to adopting SSCM practices and expanding business in a context
of heavy demand coupled with requests for rapid supply. There is a lack
of studies originating regionally as well as discontent among local suppliers who are underrepresented by common business policies and
strategies for sustainability (Jia et al., 2018). Hence, this study seeks to
fill this gap by proposing a regional comparison in the SSCM context.
3. Method
The proposed analysis steps are presented in this section to provide a
clear explanation of the data collection process, data-driven analysis, the
FDM, the EWM, and the FDEMATEL.
3.1. Proposed methods
Prior studies have identified the components of a big database for
building capabilities in the SCM (Akter et al., 2016; Zhan and Tan,
2020). Pereira and Frazzon (2020) proposed a data-driven approach that
combines machine-learning petition estimating and operational
planning simulation-based optimization for adaptive demand and supply synchronization in retail supply chains. Maroufkhani et al. (2020)
used the technological-organizational-environmental model to examine
the implementation of data-driven analysis to enhance sustainable solutions for resource and emission reduction among supply chain systems. Majeed et al. (2021) developed a modeling structure by uniting big
data analytics, additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart
manufacturing technologies, which is advantageous for additive
manufacturing initiatives. There is a lack of big data assessments using
multi-attribute decision making to enrich SSCM (Tseng et al., 2019). The
capacity to refine and validate important indicators for future directions,
and the numerical description for data incidences are absent in traditional data-driven analysis (Tsai et al., 2020). Interdependence and interrelationships among attributes and the integration of augmented
data-driven solutions into supply chain networks must be addressed to
achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness (Tseng et al., 2018b).
Due to the uncertainty and complexity of SSCM, this study proposed a
hybrid multi-attribute decision-making approach including data-driven
analysis, fuzzy set theory combined in the FDM, the EWM and the FDEMATEL. The FDM is used to refine and validate the indicators by
computing their perceived levels from experts’ linguistic references
(Tseng and Bui, 2017). The EWM is used to convert the indicator occurrence information into comparable weights to determine the indicators’
performance among regions (Tseng, 2017). The FDEMATEL method is
used to identify the perceptions through linguistic preferences and the
important indicators that require urgent attention in future research to
improve SSCM (Tseng et al., 2018a). Still, the fuzzy interpretive structural
modeling or analytic network process are more focusing on constructing
the hierarchical framework compared to other multi-criteria decision-making technique (Bui et al., 2020b, Tseng et al., 2018a). FDEMATEL is
more suitable to indicate the important indicators in the field by
addressing the causal inter-relationship between the trends and challenges. Tsai et al. (2020) used a hybrid method, including a data-driven
bibliometric analysis, FDM, and EWM to address to future study trend
and challenges of municipal solid waste management in a circular economy. Bui et al. (2021) applied a combination of data-driven analysis based
on content-bibliometric analyses, FDM, EWM, and FDEMATEL to obtain
the experts’ evaluation on SSWM towards disruption and organizational
ambidexterity. Hence, this study not only provides in-depth technique for
data-driven analysis, determine the SSWM performance of different regions, but also distinguish the critical indicators as gaps for supplementary knowledge for future studies provisions and practical executions.
3.2. Proposed analysis steps
This study offers a data-driven analysis, identifies indicators for the
improvement of future studies and outlines the differences in state-ofFig. 1. Analytical process.

the-art regional SSCM. A board of 30 experts, with no threshold for
experiences time, was selected to ensure the reliability of the evaluation
processes. The expert committee was gathered from among researchers
and practitioners with at least 10 years of experience working in and
studying SSCM, including 14 experts from academia, 5 experts from
government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and 11 experts
from the practical field. From regional viewpoint, the committee includes 10 experts from Asia and Oceania region, 5 experts from North
America region, 8 experts from Europe, 4 experts from Latin America
and Caribbean region (shown in Appendix A). The analysis steps are
proposed as follows:
1 Feasible search terms are identified to filter the SSCM big data from
the Scopus database for data collection.
2 The data-driven analysis of the collected database is conducted with
VOSviewer to identify the SSCM indicators as well as country couplings based on the authors, keywords, titles, and abstracts.
3 The FDM is used to refine the valid indicators following Eqs. (1)-(2).
The experts’ assessment of the proposed indicators is solicited using
the questionnaire.
4 The indicators’ frequency is calculated, and the EWM is employed to
convert the indicators’ entropy into comparable scales using Eqs. (3)-
(7). The regional comparison is specified for this study.
5 The important indicators for each region and the overall SSCM are
identified using the FDEMATEL and Eqs. (8)-(15) to examine future
study gaps.
A systematic diagram of the data analysis steps is presented in Fig. 1.
3.3. Data collection
Koberg and Longoni (2019) employed data on SSCM in global supply
chains from Proquest, JSTOR Archival Journals, Business SourcePremier, PLoS, ScienceDirect, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index,
Emerald Journals, Dialnet Plus, the Social Sciences Citation Index, and
the Science Citation Index. Rebs et al. (2019) used Web of Science to
retrieve relevant data on SSCM. These databases cover a smaller array of
information. In this study, the Scopus database is employed because it
covers a broader range of data than other data sources (Ansari and Kant,
2017; He et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018). To generate the SSCM database,
the search terms “("sustainable supply chain management") OR ("supply
chain management" AND "sustainability")” were used, with the results
being generated from the titles, abstracts, or keywords. The search was
limited to English-language articles and reviews.
3.4. Data-driven analysis
This study performs a data-driven analysis using VOSviewer version
1.6.11, open source software that creates scientific topographies by
categorizing documents that have similar meaning into the same cluster
to describe the relationships between them (van Eck and Waltman,
2018). In the supply chain context, Feng et al. (2017) used VOSviewer to
develop a quantitative illustration of the knowledge structure and the
intellectual progress of corporate social responsibility in SCM. Wang
et al. (2019) created a taxonomy to properly classify SCM indicators for
off-site construction using VOSviewer. Thus, VOSviewer is suitable for
use to visualize the SSCM indicators because it reveals study gaps and
opportunities for future investigation.
3.5. Fuzzy Delphi method
The combination of fuzzy set theory and the Delphi method helps
decision groups address the lack of expert references and improve
questionnaire quality (Ishikawa et al., 1993). It is used to screen out
invalid indicators by generating experts’ linguistic references (Tseng
and Bui, 2017). The method has advantages in reducing the quantity of
responses and feedback time, providing an effective assessment of experts’ judgment and relevant remarks to transform their fuzzy evaluation into exact numbers (Lee et al., 2018).
In the analytical process, assuming that there are n experts and m
indicators, expert a has to evaluate the magnitude of indicator b. This
evaluation is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers as j =
(xab; yab; zab), a = 1,2,3,…,n; b = 1,2,3,…,m, where the jb weight of b is
presented as jb = (xb; yb; zb) with xb = min(xab), yb = (
∏n
1
yab)
1/n
, and
zb = max(zab). Formally, the experts’ linguistic references are converted
into triangular fuzzy numbers, as presented in Table 1.
The convex combination value Db is computed using a γ cut as:
ub = zb − γ(zb − yb), lb = xb − γ(yb − yxb), b = 1, 2, 3,…, m (1)
This γ value can be customized from 0 to 1 to reflect a positive or
negative tendency in evaluators’ perceptions. The value of 0.5 is used to
represent a balance (Bui et al., 2020a).
Then, Db is determined by:
Db =
∫ (ub ,lb )
= δ[ub + (1 − δ)lb] (2)
with δ representing the positivity perception of the evaluators; a balance
in the ultimate assessment of the expert committee is represented by a
value of 0.5.
The threshold to refine the valid indicators is calculated using t = ∑n
a=1(Db /n). If Db ≥ t, indicator b is accepted. Otherwise, it must be
removed.
The FDM process is implemented in 2 rounds in this study. A face-toface interview with the expert committee is held to refine the SSCM
keywords and select the indicators for the FDM analysis. Round 1 aims to
eliminate the unnecessary attributes by assimilating expert judgments,
and round 2 allows experts to use their knowledge and experience to
simplify the complex attribute set from round 1 through discussion (Lee
et al., 2018). The process allows group decision making, reducing the
number of selections through rapid convergence in predicting sentiments
and thereby helping decision makers validate the decision requirement
(Bui et al., 2020a; Bui et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020).
3.6. Entropy weighted method
The differences across geographical regions are determined by
adopting the entropy weighted method. All tracking activities are coded
in an equivalent Excel file to prevent repeating the same actions and to
improve the results’ reliability. A content analysis is used for regional
consistency checks of independent coding to count the indicator frequencies for each specific region by searching the SSCM regional data
generated from the Scopus database (see Appendix B). For instance, the
search term used to generate the regional data for Africa is “TITLE-ABSKEY ("Cameroon" or "Egypt" or "Ethiopia" or "Ghana" or "Kenya" or
"Morocco" or "Nigeria" or "South Africa" or "Tanzania" or "Tunisia" or
"Uganda" or "Zimbabwe")”. The search terms are used to search the title,
abstracts, and keywords. Therefore, studies and authors addressing
multiple regions can be avoided, while the geographical issues in the
studies’ scope are still accounted for.
The indicator frequency ε takes a coefficient value between zero and

one. The value is generally set to 0.5 to reflect the general effects of the
indicators on the structure (Tseng, 2017), with:
τ0,i = ∑n
m=1
wmε0,i(m) for i = 1, 2, …m (3)
where the weight (wm,
∑wm = 1) for each distinguishing indicator is
calculated using the entropy method.
The entropy method quantifies a disorganized structure by employing weight measurement. An indicator with large entropy means and
high response diversity has a more substantial effect when it reacts to the
structure (Wen et al., 1998; Tseng, 2017). The method comprises
functionfi : [0, 1]→[0, 1] and justifies three constraints, (1) fi(0) = 0, (2)
fi(x) = fi(1 − x), and (3) fi(x), to enlarge the range of x ∈ (0, 0.5). The
largest value of this function is at x = 0.5, and the value (∂0.5 − 1) puts
the result in the range [0, 1]. The entropy weighted computational processes are as follows:
The coefficient arrangements for each indicator are computed as
follows:
Cj = ∑n
i=1
εi(j) (4)
Each indicator’s entropy weight is generated using:
ej = k
∑n

The total entropy values are calculated as follows:
E = ∑p

Each indicator’s weighted value is determined as follows:
wj =

)
∑p

3.7. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory
In this method, fuzzy set theory is employed to measure equivocal
perceptions related to linguistic judgments in an uncertain environment
and generate a crisp value, while the DEMATEL technique is designed to
causally construct intercorrelations among indicators under complex
conditions (Tseng et al., 2018a).
The method uses the defuzzification technique to convert linguistic
information into fuzzy triangular numbers and then transforms them
into crisp values. The fuzzy membership functions ̃e
k
ij = (̃e
k
1ij,̃e
k
2ij,̃e
k
3ij) are
used to compute the total weighted values. Formally, the left and right
values are calculated by the minimum and maximum fuzzy numbers.
The crisp values are subsequently obtained in the form of a total direct
relation matrix that can be used to draw a diagram to simplify the
analytical results. The interrelationship structure contains certain indicators that represent important means in the system. A set of indicators is addressed as F = {f1, f2, f3, ⋯, fn}, and accurate pairwise
evaluation is then used to create the mathematical relation.
In particular, this study obtained and accumulated crisp values using
linguistic scales from VL (very low influence) to VHI (very high influence), as presented in Table 2. If there are k experts involved in the
evaluation procedure, ̃e
k
ij specifies the fuzzy weight of the i
th indicator’s
influence on attribute j
th evaluated by expert kth.
The fuzzy numbers are abridged as follows:
F =
(

whereΔ = maxek

The left (lv) and right (rv) normalized values are determined using:
(
lvn
ij, rvn

=
[ (

(
1 + fek
2ij − fek
1ij) , fek
3ij (

]
(9)
The total normalized crisp values (cv) are formulated as:
cvk
ij =
[
lvk
ij(
1 − lvk
ij)
+
(
rvk
ij)2]
(
1 − lvk
ij + rvk
ij) (10)
The synthetic values’ symbolization to accrue individual insight
from k respondents is afterward implemented by:
̃e
k
ij =
(
cv1
ij + cv2
ij + cv3
ij + ⋯ + cv3
ij)
k (11)
A pairwise comparison is manipulated to acquire a direct relation
(IM) n × n initial matrix, where ̃e
k
ij refers to the efficient level of indicator i on indicator j, moderated as IM = [̃e
k
ij]n×n.
The normalized direct relation matrix (U) is formed as:
U = τ ⊗ IM
τ = 1
max
1≤i≤k
∑k
j=1
̃e
k
ij
(12)
The interrelationship matrix (W) is obtained from the normalized
direct relation matrix using:
W = U(I − U)
− 1 (13)
where W is[wij]
n×n i,j = 1,2,⋯n
The values of the driving power (α) and dependence power (β) are
assimilated from the summation of the row and column values in the
interrelationship matrix using:
=
[
∑n
i− 1
wij]
n×n
= [wi]n×1 (14)
=
[
∑n
j− 1
wij]
n×n

wj
]
1×n (15)
The indicators are positioned in an interrelationship diagram derived
from [( + ), ( − )], which in turn presents horizontal and vertical
axes. The indicators are grouped into cause and affect groups based on
whether the ( − ) values are positive or negative. (α + β) displays the
importance of the indicators: the higher the (α + β) value an indicator
has, the more important it is. This study uses the average value of (α + β)
to identify the most important causal indicators, which then require

implications obtained from the FDEMATEL analysis are examined.
4.1. Data-driven analysis
This study generates co-occurrence couplings of author keywords
extracted from Scopus (see Appendix C). There are 251 keywords listed
with at least 5 occurrences. There are 92 countries/territories listed,
with the minimum number of documents for a country being equal to 1.
Then, for further evaluation, the countries/territories are separated into
5 geographical regions based on the UN countries list (2019), namely,
Asia and Oceania, Europe, North America, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and Africa (shown in Appendix D).
4.2. Fuzzy Delphi method
There are 127 indicators identified from the 151 author keywords
that co-occur. The summaries from rounds 1 and 2 of the FDM are shown
in Appendix E and Appendix F, along with the weights and the threshold
for validating the indicator attributes. In round 1, the set of SSCM indicators is evaluated based on the experts’ experience and judgment,
and the linguistic terms are converted into conforming triangular fuzzy
numbers in Table 1. The FDM refines the indicator, which can be found
in Appendix E. There are 54 barriers that are accepted with a threshold
of 0.302.
Then, the refined set is used for input in round 2. In this round, the
indicators set in round 1 are reproduced for the experts’ redefinition.
The results show that 22 out of 54 indicators are accepted, while the
other 32 are rejected (as presented in Appendix F) with a threshold of
0.298. The final FDM indicator set is shown in Table 3.
4.3. Entropy weighted method
Table 4 presents the indicator entropy weights for each region. The
EWM uses entropy to represent the amount of information. The higher
the indicator values are, the more information they contain. In other
words, the larger the entropy value is, the smaller the entropy weight
(He et al., 2016) and the more information the indicator provides.
Hence, this study uses the average weighted technique to determine the
level of indicator information in each region. If the weight is greater
than the average, the indicator must be improved, shown in Table 5. The
results show that Asia and Oceania have the highest amount of information in the field of SSCM, followed by Europe and North America. In
contrast, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean have less information, and there is still much room for SSCM development in these
regions.
4.4. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory
From the FDM indicator set, the experts evaluated the indicator interrelationships using the provided linguistic scales (see Table 2). The
fuzzy direct relation matrix and the defuzzification are characterized to
compute the average crisp value for all respondents and used to create
the initial direction matrix, presented in Table 6. The total interrelationship matrix is generated (see Table 7), as is the interrelationship
among indicators, shown in Table 8. Fig. 2 presents the interrelationship
diagram among regions based on the (α +β) and (α − β) axes. The
average value of (α + β) is used to identify the most important causal
indicators that require attention. The results show that there are some
differences between regions. In particular, Asia and Oceania focus on big
data (I1), industry 4.0 (I10), policy (I13), remanufacturing (I15), and
supply chain network design (SCND) (I20). The important indicators for

Europe are big data (I1), closed-loop supply chain (I4), policy (I13), and
remanufacturing (I15). The most important indicators of the Latin
American and Caribbean regions include industry 4.0 (I10), policy (I13),
remanufacturing (I15), and risk management (I17) SCND (I20). For
North America, the important indicators consist of big data (I1), closedloop supply chain (I4), industry 4.0 (I10), remanufacturing (I15), and
SCND (I20). Big data (I1), eco-efficiency (I5), policy (I13), risk management (I17), and SCND (I20) are important indicators for Africa.
Overall, the most important indicators for SSCM are big data (I1),
closed-loop supply chain (I4), industry 4.0 (I10), policy (I13), remanufacturing (I15), and SCND (I20). These indicators are considered to have
continuing effects as well as response effects within SSCM. They are
identified as the most critical study trends enhancing SSCM.
5. Discussions
This section discusses the state-of-the-art of SSCM, future study
trends and challenges and the geographical regional implications.
5.1. SSCM state-of-the-art, study trends, and challenges
The results show that the most important indicators for SSCM are big
data, closed-loop supply chain, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing,
and SCND. These indicators are considered to play critical roles in
guiding the research and posing challenges for SSCM enhancement.
5.1.1. Big data
Big data has attracted researchers and practitioners’ attention in the
past few years because of its ability to generate insights in real time that
can then be incorporated (Kaur and Singh, 2018). Big data is defined as
high volume, high velocity and high variety data that are used in the
decision-making process and require innovative techniques to be
managed (Beyer and Laney, 2012). The parameters for big data based on
inter-intra heterogeneity with the 3Vs—variety, volume and velocity—in
which (i) variety considers development sources involving multiple
products, periods, suppliers, and carriers; numerous emissions, capacity,
cost, and demand issues; and supplier, product, time, and carrier functions; (ii) volume refers to big data storage with the number of suppliers,
available carriers, number of products and periods; and (iii) velocity is
related to data acquisition and reflects the propensity of data to adjust on
a real-time basis, an example being the supplier and carrier capability
and product demand fluctuations that occur within each period (Lamba
and Singh, 2016). Big data has rapidly grown and extended based on its
application and operating procedures in each specific business. Two
additional parameters are (iv) value-added with the intention of generating value from cloud computing or the internet of things and (v) veracity regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the big data analysis
used by manufacturing, because the value of big data cannot be scrutinized only by simple statistics (Sandhu and Sood, 2015; Addo-Tenkorang
and Helo, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Wang and Hajli, 2017).
Indeed, big data analytics now plays a crucial role in SSCM (Li et al.,
2019). It is useful to develop supply chain capability in practice using
new technologies, such as data-driven analysis, providing instruments to
optimize the data generation process, offering data integration from
various foundations, conforming different categories of findings to the
business process, and visualizing the data to simplify decision-making
(Dubey et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2017). Big data influences the supply chain and integrates both upstream and downstream
operations to improve the organization’s sustainable performance
(Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Therefore, the big data concept contributes
to SSCM by building knowledgeable decisions, providing administration
and risk mitigation, enhancing operational processes, presenting new
products to the market, and scrutinizing the market (Schoenherr and
Speier-Pero, 2015). This also has positive impacts on supply chain and
operational performance, business values, sustainable procurement, and
sustainable manufacturing (Kaur and Singh, 2018; Ren et al., 2019).
These help to form an expressive understanding that supports multifaceted SSCM assessments (Gandomi and Haider, 2015; Tsai et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2018).
In the literature, a social media data analytics technique has been
developed for analyzing supply chain and logistics operations (Singh
et al., 2018). An environmentally sustainable procurement and logistics
model for a supply chain has been proposed that uses big data to assess
the variety of real-time boundaries from the purchaser and supplier
sides, including lead times, capabilities, costs, and discharge (Kaur and
Singh, 2018). SSCM knowledge was explored by determining barriers to
big data analytics in manufacturing supply chains (Moktadir et al.,
2019a). The role of big data in extending sustainable capabilities was
examined as driven by the firm’s commitment, the practices of green
human resources and SCM to improve sustainability performance

(Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Big data addresses capabilities to handle
the problem of carbon emission costs by coordinating a low-carbon
supply chain, along with identifying a firm’s financial situation by
providing advanced technological tools for data management wherein
datasets are aggregated in a structured manner (Liu, 2019; Raut et al.,
2019). Therefore, the decision-making efficiency and effectiveness of
big data must be utilized to offer competitive advantages to firms and to
make their supply chain resilient as it approaches SSCM performance.
Failures still exist due to a lack of big data assessment infrastructure
and understanding, and other data utilization and implementation issues related to supply chains (Moktadir et al., 2019a). Traditional big
data collection, retrieval and evaluation methods are no longer appropriate for the current challenges and opportunities of SSCM and business
operations, though they have the potential to renovate business and
guarantee organizational response implementation (Hampton et al.,
2013; Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Seles et al., 2018;). In SCM, firms are
challenged by insufficient resources, time-consuming behavioral issues,
return on investment and financial problems, and privacy-security
anxieties (Arunachalam et al., 2018). Despite the enormous scope of
big data, very few attempts have been made to develop big data applications in SSCM. The fundamental competencies, capabilities, internal
mechanisms and processes through which big data formulation may
result in better performance strategies have not yet been fully investigated (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Most supply chain resolutions have
yet to integrate big data features into the decision-making process
despite the enormous amount of data generated for both the supplier
and buyer sides (Kaur and Singh, 2018). Hence, there is a substantial
need to jointly consider big data in SSCM. Because big data are essential
in highly uncertain and competitive marketplaces, there is much room
for further development and investigation.
5.1. 2. Closed-loop supply chain
Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are studied and implemented
because they play a substantial role by taking advantage of recyclable
resources and inhibiting waste inflows into the environment (Wang et al.,
2018). CLSCs include two fundamental phases: the forward and reverse
supply chains (Amin and Zhang, 2012). The forward chain refers to the
flow of new products that are delivered from manufacturers to consumers, while the reverse chain is described as the return flow of used,
defective, and open box products collected from consumers and transferred to manufacturers or recycling centers (Assarzadegan and Rasti-Barzoki, 2019; Das and Dutta, 2016; Fathollahi-Fard and HajiaghaeiKeshteli, 2018). The practices include identifying product waste, collecting, separating, packing, storing, recalling, transferring, distributing
and recovering value (Mohtashami et al., 2020). The aim is to optimize
the product used throughout its entire life cycle by incorporating reverse
logistics as a preliminary advanced supply chain from purchase to final
sale for used product recovery (Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2009).
Hence, an efficient CLSC design may result in reducing the environmental
impact in addition to meeting economic and social goals.
The CLSC is essential to creating supplementary logistics infrastructure in terms of synchronizing a robust return supply chain involving
steps such as sorting, remanufacturing and allocating to disposal centers
(Darbari et al., 2019). Previous studies have addressed different issues
related to CLSCs, such as network design, production planning, and inventory management. Two-level reverse logistics were compared between online recycling and traditional recycling to investigate CLSC
design and coordination (Feng et al., 2017). A risk and disruption
handling model for the CLSC was proposed to minimize costs while
identifying facility distribution and quantities for transportation (Jabbarzadeh et al., 2018). A decision model for service, pricing, and
third-party recycling in three distinct remanufacturing positions and
authorized technology was developed (Zhao et al., 2019). Multiproduct
circular supplier selection decision-making and order allocation were
assessed considering multiple depots and green routing capacity using

heterogeneous vehicles (K. Govindan et al., 2020). Closed-loop optimal

operational planning of supply chains with rapid product quality dynamics was studied, with byproduct quality dynamics and environmental
conditions explicitly considered (Lejarza and Baldea, 2020).
Although the CLSC has been positively assessed, as it recovers
returned products’ value, ensures that environmental standards are
upheld and enhances customer rights, few studies have developed
quantitative approaches to adopting a holistic perspective of sustainability (Heydari et al., 2017). Most attention has been directed toward
economic perspectives, though considerations have been given to
capability positioning decisions and multiple stakeholders themselves
(Sahebjamnia et al., 2018). Few scholars have sought to design sustainable networks to solve such problems because of the uncertainty and
low demand for remanufactured products (Bouzon et al., 2018; Govindan and Bouzon, 2018; Chouman et al., 2018). In addition, managerial
measures, extended manufacturer responsibility systems, regulatory
guidance for intellectual property protection, technical and quality
standards for recycling systems, and social issues such as consumers’
awareness and quality concerns regarding remanufactured products are
still under investigation (Rahmaniani et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019).
Because CLSCs are highly important due to their direct impact on political, economic, and environmental problems, accurate and efficient
solutions are required.
5.1.3. Industry 4.0
The concept of industry 4.0 is founded on three principal elements:
cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, and smart factories (Hofmann and Rusch, 2017; Tseng et al., 2018b). Industrial evolution is reflected in smart production or integrated manufacturing capabilities,
which affect the entire industry in terms of product design,
manufacturing and transportation (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017). Industry
4.0 provides more efficient solutions for monitoring the production system and transforming the manufacturing industry scenario by changing
supply chain processes, changing business activities and integrating
sustainability to enhance the flexibility of supply chain operations
(Bechtsis et al., 2017; de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018). Industry 4.0 is
recognized as a future development in SSCM, with prearranged interrelationships among materials, equipment, and products and sufficient consumer demand in a dynamic situation. Industry 4.0 represents
the application of a mixture of digital technology and intelligence to
interlocking supply chain networks and enables product customization
(Lasi et al., 2014). It can be applied to production lines and can advance a
total cyber-corporal system of equipment, machines, and smart infrastructure to achieve superior data interchange and mechanisms using
appropriate information technology safety solutions, product maintenance and human skills through professional skill sets and shared information among supply chain partners (Branke et al., 2016).
Industry 4.0 considerably changes the approach to SCM (Tjahjono
et al., 2017). Its applications beyond a sustainability orientation
encompass environmental protection and mechanical advantages as
well as advanced safety issues, resource efficiency, human resources,
communication, and smarter and flexible measurement in the supply
chain (Luthra and Mangla, 2018). Rajput and Singh (2019) found a
hidden relationship between the circular economy and industry 4.0 from
the two sides of enablers and barriers in the supply chain context. Singh
et al. (2019) approached SSCM development through the enhancement
of resource utilization and proficiency along with the improvement of
the supply chain functions of automated procurement, production, and
delivery. There are four significant SSCM paradigms, agile, green, lean,
and resilient, to industry 4.0 machines to increase supply chain performance and sustainability (Ramirez-Pena ˜ et al., 2019). Different aspects

of embedded sustainable supply chains and formulated an outline for
evaluating organizational readiness to meet the requirements of the
industry 4.0 revolution (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). An intelligent sustainable supplier selection using multiagent technology for
industry 4.0 supply chains to offer advanced communication networks,
information exchange structures and transparency among supply chain
partners (Ghadimi et al., 2019). Organizational supply chains and sustainability are now forced to adopt industry 4.0 modern technological
improvements and promote innovation. These advances provide vast
opportunities for industry 4.0 supply chain intelligence and autonomy,
creating a critical role for these features in terms of sustainability
development (Kamble et al., 2018).
The concept requires in-depth understanding and empirical practice
(Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017). Although the exploratory use of industry
4.0 to identify sustainability in the supply chain has gained considerable
attention, it may not yet be fully recognized. Academic and managerial
implications are limited and still at an early stage of development
(Tseng et al., 2018b). Little effort has been made to incorporate sustainability issues, and the sustainability TBL dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) still lack integration within SSCM for an
extended industry 4.0 (Ghadimi et al., 2016, 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
Coordination and collaboration problems, security concerns, a lack of
governmental support and policies, and the absence of sufficient
financial resources to make investments may make it challenging for
small-scale industries to implement industry 4.0 (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Pfohl et al., 2017; Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019).
Additionally, industry 4.0 is difficult to integrate with SSCM due to data
quality and credibility problems, unemployment, complexity, reduced
human control, and higher negative environmental impacts. Problems
with a lack of technological innovation; strategic, ethical, and global
policy; the management of supply chain disruptions; facilities planning;
and the development of international manufacturing networks remain
unsolved (Branke et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019).
Hence, further studies are needed to address such issues based on the
value of smart industry.
5.1.4. Supply chain policy
The supply chain is a complicated phenomenon and flexible system
affected not only by technical upheaval but also by dynamic and uncertain
factors, for example, sociocultural and geopolitical issues such as export
bans, unpredictable markets, and environmental regulations (Mancheri
et al., 2019). The influence of regulatory legislation on the formation of
the SSCM is one of the key tactical elements requiring focused attention
(Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Supply chain policy endorsements
aim to control the effects of location, production, inventory and the
disposal of products and create a trade-off between transportation,
holding costs and profit (Waltho et al., 2018). Supply chain policy is
considered to encourage remanufacturing and improved resource efficiency (Zhang et al., 2019a). The policy generally plays an important role
in modifying the sustainable development of the whole supply chain,
being integrated as a decision-maker to maximize sustainable benefits
rather than as a measured constraint on firm profit functions in the effort
to synchronize supply chain operations (Liu et al., 2019b).
An increasing number of researchers have turned their attention to
this area of study, as policies have begun to impact SSCM. The influence
of government taxes and policy related to environmental protection on
the optimum assessment of the supply chain considering government
financial involvement has been analyzed (Hafezalkotob, 2015; Hafezalkotob et al., 2016). The effect of three types of government policies on
two rival supply chain decision-making processes is under either
decentralization or centralization (Zhang and Wang, 2017). Different
environmental tax policies in a multi-tiered supply chain network rivalry under stable governing circumstances were captured (Yu and
Cruz, 2018). A sustainable supply chain optimization system considering lead time in different production-distribution and inventory scenarios was proposed, with three carbon emission policies: strict carbon
capping, carbon cap and trade, and a carbon tax (Manupati et al., 2019).
The influence of critical success factors on the development of
energy-efficient supply chains and their energy policy implications were
presented (Moktadir et al., 2019b). A trade credit policy that enriches
SSCM under green manufacturing optimization and payment records
(Tiwari et al., 2018). The impacts of transfer pricing policies and subsidy
policies on CLSCs with retailer and third-party dual collection channels
have been analyzed (Wan and Hong, 2019). The optimal inspection
policy for customers to encourage responsible sourcing efforts and the
relationship of this mechanism to customer awareness was investigated
in the context of the supply chain (Zarei et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, the appropriate policy and legislative framework to
regulate supply chain actors in the direction of sustainable goals has
presented a constant challenge. It was found that some national legislation does not satisfy the objective of environmental protection and
violates international policy (Gavin, 2013; Mancheri, 2015; Mancheri
et al., 2019). Advancements in carbon emission standards due to rapid
industrialization require SCM assessment to avoid compromising social
responsibility, environmental performance, and economic mechanisms
(Babazadeh et al., 2017; Samadi et al., 2018). Globalization policies
have eliminated restrictions on market boundaries, making it hard for
small and medium-sized firms to compete with large global organizations, as small firms are incapable of adapting advanced technologies to
process new types of materials or of effectively utilizing resources and
reducing energy consumption (Thomas and Trentesaux, 2014).
Although many countries and geographical regions are employing
standard environmental mechanisms, including incentives or mandatory targets for firms to reduce their environmental impacts, the advocated interventions still address internal problems in SSCM, such as
illegal production, transaction and processing; lack of innovation;
congestion; and poor legal and regulatory systems (Yu and Cruz, 2018;
Zhang and Yousaf, 2019). In developing regions, inadequate laws and
regulations result in serious social problems, such as manufacturing
using child labor, unsustainable performance, and unsanctioned activities, which arise in the early stages of the supply chain (Awaysheh and
Klassen, 2010; Silvestre, 2015; Jia et al., 2020). Hence, there are opportunities in the optimization of the number of manufacturers and
stowage to integrate sustainability elements, improve supply chain
network allocation, and enhance capacity in supply chain facilities and
infrastructure, and other solutions present themselves in supplier selection and remanufacturing regulatory systems. The lack of study in
this direction hinders the transition to SSCM for both policy makers and
their initial stakeholders.
5.1.5. Remanufacturing
Remanufacturing is defined as a multi-processes that transforms endof-use products by recovering, checking, disassembling, polishing,
renovating, and reassembling to produce a “like-new” product (Govindan et al., 2016; Kafuku et al., 2016). The processes consist of raw
material acquisition, reverse delivery, manufacturing procedures, and
distribution operations, which ultimately offer large reductions in
resource and energy consumption and waste emissions, increased care
for the environment, and support for sustainable development (Jiang
et al., 2019). Remanufacturing is emphasized as an urgent innovation
strategy to slow resource circles. It calls for the integration of design and
business system innovations supporting new forms of collaboration,
including multiple transactions between suppliers and manufacturers
and among manufacturers and buyers and consumers, to comprehend
and apply new circular business models combined with new product
design considerations (Opresnik and Taisch, 2015). Hence, benefits from
remanufacturing implementation could be realized by all business firms,
their consumers, the environment, society, and several third parties
(Ansari et al., 2019).
Remanufacturing is an emergent but rapidly developing sector that
slows environmental degradation and resource diminution through
material reuse and recycling to meet the sustainable goals of SCM (Zhang
F.M. Tsai et al. 
Resources, Conservation & Recycling 167 (2021) 105421
13
et al., 2011; Subramoniam et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017). Case studies in
four remanufacturing organizations were conducted to study the influence of implementing lean practices on reducing needless processes and
decreasing lead time, thus improving the organizations’ operational
performance (Kurilova-Palisaitiene et al., 2018). A remanufacturing
process that adopts adaptive design was proposed to classify the factors
that influence environmental and economic performance (Krystofik
et al., 2018). The prioritized performance outcomes obtained via
implementing critical success factors in supply chain remanufacturing
were investigated (Ansari et al., 2019). Recycling and remanufacturing
approaches in the supply chain were explored through the heterogeneous
considerations of consumers (Long et al., 2019). An integrated perspective for determining sustainable value creation was investigated in the
context of remanufacturing models (Jensen et al., 2019). A supply chain
consisting of a manufacturer and retailer was assessed in terms of managing a CLSC with process innovation for remanufacturing (Reimann
et al., 2019). The trade-offs related to cap-and-trade and carbon taxes
were analyzed based on a CLSC model (Hu et al., 2020). Integrating
remanufacturing into the supply chain is a critical strategy that positively
encourages sustainable organizational performance.
Although remanufacturing is one of the economic and environmental
factors that has received considerable attention, the literature mostly
focuses on technology and management, and relatively few studies have
evaluated sustainability (Taleizadeh et al., 2017, 2019; Zerang et al.,
2018; Shaharudin et al., 2019b). Ensuring the evaluation of remanufacturing sustainability would be helpful for generating insights into
resource utilization and environmental safety and should be prioritized
by researchers (Zhang et al., 2019b). Gaps remain in the TBL indicator
measurements (Jensen et al., 2019). To date, previous studies have only
scratched the surface and are limited to exploring each single indicator,
and the full picture of the social, environmental and economic problems
of remanufacturing has not been fully recognized as an integral part of
SSCM (Souza, 2013; Reimann et al., 2019). While the fact that economic
concerns are positioned at the forefront of remanufacturing is widely
acknowledged, there is little awareness of the possibility of improving
remanufacturability to support environmental protection and benefit
social wellbeing.
There is still immense recklessness due to the inadequate study and
expansion of remanufacturing systems. In reality, the reselling and
remarketing of remanufactured products is challenging because consumers may have few incentives to purchase remanufactured products
(Xu et al., 2017). Only a few studies integrate both collaboration and
competition into remanufacturing optimization systems, which would
adjust the functional level and organizational strategies (Rau et al.,
2019). The manufacturer may distrust third-party remanufacturers or
retailers due to their limited production scope or brand issues while
charging them an inconstant or stationary rate (Zhao et al., 2019). Many
studies do not consider multilevel construction or discrete changes in
value parameters such as pricing or demand patterns, even though these
may have long-term negative influences (Hong et al., 2017). Further
investigation of remanufacturing supply chain behavior is urgent and
requires more attention. In addition, the lack of laws and policies, the
evaluation of waste product remanufacturability, energy conservation
problems, comparisons of different remanufacturing systems, how to
ensure that the quality of new and remanufactured products is the same,
and technology licenses have been discussed (Taleizadeh et al., 2019;
Zhang et al., 2019b). Remanufacturing studies have several shortcomings and are still far from fulfilling the needs of the current context.
5.1.6. Supply chain network design
SCND plays a major role in manipulating supply chain operations
(Waltho et al., 2018). The concept refers to constructing an effective
network for different supply chain entities (Farahani et al., 2014). It
represents the facility location problem, and SCM encompasses facility
location determination, magnitude, network capabilities and the material flow among the located facilities (Pishvaee and Razmi, 2012). In
designing a sustainable supply chain, SCND attempts to delineate the
best supply chain alignment to maximize economic profitability, environmental performance, and social performance in the long term
(Chaabane et al., 2012). Considering all parts of the system together and
inspecting the product flow and information effects through the network
are essential to making a supply chain ready for operation (Rodger,
2014). Because the supply chain network is a set of people, activities,
and information that interact to convert raw material into useful products and deliver them to the end customer, the SCND covers decisions
regarding supplier selection, transportation, production technology,
storage capacity, and market demand allocation (Moreno-Camacho
et al., 2019). Integration creates more complex problems for the supply
chain, with multiple conflicts and contradictory intent in multidimensional decision making (Sherafati et al., 2019).
Recent studies have considered SCND perspectives. An optimization
model for SCDN was developed that accounted for financial resources
such as trade credit and bank credit (Alavi and Jabbarzadeh, 2018). The
SCND problem with the assembly balancing process was analyzed
considering a three-layer supply chain including manufacturers, assemblers, and customers that could be decomposed into an upper-level
problem and two lower-level problems (Sun and Wang, 2019). A bilevel
programming model for hierarchized SCND that thoroughly considers
inducements to use cleaner technologies was presented (Chalmardi and
Camacho-Vallejo, 2019). Three pillars of sustainability were considered
and discussed to design a supply chain network that maximizes turnover
while seizing opportunities for social development in less developed regions as a priority (Sherafati et al., 2019). An optimal multi-objective
multiproduct supply chain network was designed for efficient and
optimal product quantity plans (Mohammed and Duffuaa, 2020).
These studies have only considered regional development and
concentrated on balancing economic development. Environmental objectives such as pollutant emissions play a significant role but have been
ignored in network design problems (Zohal and Soleimani, 2016). The
innovative design and planning of supply chain networks needs to give
more consideration to all TBL dimensions due to the global sustainable
development trend. There should be further investigation into the
optimal solution for SCND entities. Increasing competitiveness, a global
market and a dynamic environment are required to meet customers’
demand while minimizing costs (Sherafati et al., 2019). This sequence
has a substantial effect on society and the environment (Manupati,
2019). The uncertainty in SCND could be an interesting topic for future
studies. Few studies have developed strong simulations for resolving
multi-objective SCND, and reverse logistics and closed-loop supply
chain networks are significant issues (Mohammed and Duffuaa, 2020).
The development of a model considering facility disruptions will also
further SCND. Hence, proposals for sustainable SCND should still be
pursued and need to be improved as a future trend in SSCM research.
5.2. Regional implications
The results show that Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa are
two regions that need to improve their SSCM performance. These regions also show different trends than the other regions. In particular,
Latin America and the Caribbean should focus more on risk management, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and SCND, while Africa
shows concerning patterns related to eco-efficiency and risk management, in addition to the other common trends.
5.2.1. Latin America and the Caribbean
Supply chains involve complex environmental and social elements
aligned with varied participant prospects that aggravate risk-related
sustainability (Rebs et al., 2018). Firms refuse to change their goods
to satisfy regulations, bribe government agencies to fake inspection
documents to gain legitimacy, and lack operational transparency
(Azmat and Ha, 2013). Suppliers cheat their customers by buying guarantees through certification labels from third-party auditors without
F.M. Tsai et al. 
Resources, Conservation & Recycling 167 (2021) 105421
14
satisfying the practical requirements (Jia et al., 2018). Purchasers
continue to buy products produced with child labor or that causes
environmental pollution due to their low price without calling for
responsible practices (Otanez and Glantz, 2011). There is acquiescence
to crises and imitation among supply chain stakeholders, certification
providers and the government (Silvestre, 2015), implying that SSCM
may expose a high level of risk that corrupts network performance. The
perceived impacts and effects from the risks that actually exist may
cause serious damage to SCs (Soni and Kodali, 2013). Nevertheless, the
region is a fast-growing market; poor infrastructure, booming urbanization, expensive and inefficient logistics, and many social issues
continue to cause major problems, as noted by both practitioners and
scholars (Yoshizaki et al., 2018). Therefore, future studies should invest
in offering better support for the risk management decision-making
process in Latin America and the Caribbean region.
Risk management entails supply chain responses that counteract
vulnerabilities by choosing the most appropriate risk response solution
and planning how that solution should be applied (Manuj et al., 2014;
Sahebjamnia et al., 2018). The main practice is to ensure the capability
to prevent the unnecessary disruption of barriers, which represents a
disadvantage for environmental performance due to the negative impact
of supply chain activities on resource consumption (Carvalho and
Cruz-Machado, 2011). The type of response chosen by decision makers
is affected by the risk consequences (Heckmann et al., 2015). In fact,
uncertainty drives firms to move from an effective approach to integrated efficient solutions where efficiency is only important when it
ensures an adequate level of SCM to address unpredicted events. The
increasing market volatility in the region, as well as the increasing
fluctuation of demand and risk of supply disruption lead to a push for
more agile, less expensive and more flexible supply chain design due to
natural disasters or human activity.
Supply chain risk management practices could impact environmental
performance, but studies do not investigate further whether this impact is
positive or negative (Govindan et al., 2014). More elaboration of the
complex challenges associated with SSCM methods is needed, given that
the multidimensional sustainable viewpoints proposed by SSCM bring
together a set of goals and agendas that include a potential risk of conflict
between organizations and insiders (Bastas and Liyanage, 2018). This
requires firms to standardize and replicate their virtual supply chain
process as globalization advances. Risk identification, assessment,
management, monitoring, control, and communication and the development of simulation models and optimization technology combined
with efficient SCND models represent potential gaps for further exploration (Oliveira et al., 2019). The Latin America and Caribbean supply
chain sector now has great potential to invest in not only practical
implementation but also academic development with the aggregate of
countries having high production capabilities and global interaction.
5.2.2. Africa
Africa holds a small market share in the global supply chain network
but has high potential to reduce the risk for new entrants, as
manufacturing is expected to expand widely due to active investment
from India and China. The region faces complex elements that have
permanently changed the supply chain environment. This context requires strong analytical ability, a holistic competitive model design, and
significant improvement in decision-making ability to meet the market
demand or even the global standard. Only a few countries can achieve
the distinct capability to develop economic development-based, ongoing
innovation and the technology associated with low-cost labor. Poor
supply chain infrastructure and facilities, a lack of training and education, a large knowledge gap, energy consumption problems, a lack of
leadership, payment delays on initial investments, an unequal structure
and high management risks are issues that remain unsolved (Moktadir
et al., 2019b). The integration of multidimensional assessments into
SCM will result in more balanced, comprehensive and efficient SSCM
implementation, thereby minimizing the risk by prioritizing certain aspects over others (Bastas and Liyanage, 2018). In addition,
eco-efficiency is also a critical challenge that the region must tackle to
improve its SSCM. Eco-efficiency refers to a quantitative management
solution that enables a product system to balance resource use through
the adoption of a more sustainable concept while still bringing profit to
stakeholders (Vasquez ´ et al., 2019). Sustainability concerns have highlighted the significant role of eco-efficient supply chain identification in
balancing social, environmental, and economic objectives (Jonkman
et al., 2019). The solution quantifies the operating costs associated with
reducing environmental impacts without changing consumption and
resource productivity, which is calculated as the value or produced
quantity divided by the natural resources required for production of the
product (Kulak et al., 2016).
Experiential and reliable data are not sufficient to develop more ecoefficient modes in Africa. As national and local data are difficult to
collect, the impact of uncertainty on the TBL and other eco-efficient
solutions must be quantified through measurement. Nevertheless,
most studies in this region assume all data to be deterministic, and uncertainty is rarely taken into account when presenting decision support
models for eco-efficient supply chains (Banasik et al., 2019), which
presents challenges for further investigation. There are limitations, and
research gaps have been identified. The conceptual framework between
“efficiency” and “eco-efficiency” in theoretical, practical and empirical
studies is not clearly addressed (Huang et al., 2018). Procurement and
infrastructure activities are not precise and do not clearly define how
they meet sustainable development targets, and a lack of sound legislation and policy frameworks hinders SSCM implementation (Vasquez ´
et al., 2019). Operational barriers; a lack of administration commitment,
financial costs and constraints; environmental sustainability problems;
poorly integrated monitoring information and traceability systems; poor
multitier suppliers; low consumer awareness and demand; and inadequate provision and leadership from industry alliances, NGOs and
development agencies still need to be addressed (Agyemang et al., 2018;
Jov´e-Llopis and Segarra-Blasco, 2018).
Concluding remarks
SSCM has grown rapidly in recent decades and has received much
attention from both scholars and practitioners. Although different aspects of the literature and its evolution have been summarized, previous
studies have evaluated different parts of the supply chain as independent
entities. An integrated assessment is still missing in the extant literature,
making it necessary to reveal potential directions for future studies.
Hence, this study proposed a hybrid method integrating data-driven
analysis, the FDM, the EWM, and the FDEMATEL to (1) identify the
critical indicators for future study trends and debate and (2) determine
the challenges and knowledge gaps among geographical regions.
Quantitative and qualitative approaches are proposed to complement
the systematic review and address the challenges of uncertainty and
complexity in SSCM. The data-driven analysis applied the VOSviewer
and identified the SSCM indicators based on big data from Scopus, with
the results represented as visualized information. The FDM is used to
refine the valid indicators by computing their perception levels from
experts’ linguistic references. The EWM is applied to convert the indicator occurrence information into comparable weights to determine the
indicator performance among regions. The FDEMATEL method is used
to capture the perceptions through linguistic preferences and identify
the substantial indicators that should be urgently addressed in future

work to improve SSCM. This study contributes to detecting critical indicators as gaps to provide knowledge that assists further studies and
practical implementations.
• A data-driven analysis is delivered to determine the critical indicators as gaps for future studies. There are 251 keywords listed,
and 21 indicators are of critical concerns based on the experts’
evaluation. The most important indicators are chosen as essential for
future research and include big data, closed-loop supply chain, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and SCND.
• A prioritization of exploration opportunities is proposed. Since supply chain systems are large and complex, integrating and considering
the effect of the flow of products, services, and information through
the network are important to operational management (Mohammed
et al., 2020). The relationship between the trends and challenges is
also worth investigating in future studies.
• The identified gaps between geographical regions not only
contribute local viewpoints but also delineate the comprehensive
global state of the art of SSCM. Ninety-two countries/territories were
accumulated and then rearranged to provide results for 5 regions:
Asia and Oceania, Europe, North America, Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean. The results showed that the largest amount of SSCM
information is provided for Asia and Oceania, followed by Europe
and North America. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa
show a need for improvement. Latin America and the Caribbean
should focus more on risk management, while Africa shows a distinct
pattern of concern regarding eco-efficiency and risk management, in
addition to other common trends.
• SSCM actors can treat this study as a reference source for decision
making. Firms, governments and professionals can refer to this study
for useful information supporting practical design, policy strategies
and perceived planning based on regional insights to endorse innovative accomplishments.
Some limitations exist in this study. The data-driven analysis may not
be sufficiently detailed to initiate quality assessment because Scopus
also includes low-impact sources and is limited to the most recent information (Shukla et al., 2019). A future study is proposed that engages
a more refined database for better results. Third, the expert committee
consisted of only 30 members, which may result in biases in the analysis
process due to their experience, knowledge, and familiarity with the
research field. Increasing the volume of respondents is recommended to
avoid this problem. As this study offers an exhaustive method for
data-driven analysis, both academic and practical investigations are
encouraged to exploit it in other sectors.
