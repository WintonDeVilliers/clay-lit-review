# Literature Review: International Internet Law and State Responsibility in Cyberspace

## Introduction

The Internet has emerged as a significant global challenge, yet international law has struggled to address it
comprehensively. This literature review aims to explore the evolving framework of international Internet
law (IIL) and the application of the due diligence principle to cyberspace, considering issues such as
cyber-security, jurisdiction, and privacy protection. By synthesizing the provided research findings, this
review will highlight the gaps in knowledge and suggest potential future research directions.

## Evolution of International Internet Law

Kulesza (2012) emphasizes that international scholarship has largely failed to address the Internet as
a whole, hindering the application of established international law principles to this contemporary
challenge. The author presents IIL as a new branch of international public law and discusses its genesis,
principles, and perspectives. Drawing analogies with traditional areas of international law, such as environmental law, human rights law, and the law of the sea, the article highlights the need for a comprehensive
framework for Internet governance.

## Applying the Due Diligence Principle in Cyberspace

The due diligence principle, which holds states responsible for preventing their territories from being used
for activities harmful to other states, is explored in the context of cyberspace (Semanticscholar.org). This
principle, under international law, requires states to take reasonable measures to prevent cyber operations
originating from their territories that may cause harm. However, the feasibility of this obligation is subject
to debate.

## State Responsibility and Countermeasures in Cyberspace

The relationship between the due diligence principle and the taking of countermeasures by victim states
in response to cyber operations conducted from abroad is analyzed (Semanticscholar.org). The principle
may provide victim states with a means to respond to harmful cyber activities conducted by non-state
actors located outside their territory. This highlights the potential of state responsibility in cyberspace to
address the challenges posed by cyber threats effectively.

## Role of Soft Law in International Internet Law

Kulesza (2012) emphasizes the role of soft law in creating IIL and presents successful examples of its
exercise. Soft law refers to non-binding norms and guidelines that can shape state behavior. The author

suggests that the exercise of soft law can contribute to the development of IIL and address the regulatory
gaps in Internet governance. However, the need for hard-law proposals is also recognized to further
advance IIL.

## Proposals for International Internet Law

In the context of IIL, Kulesza (2012) presents proposals for hard-law measures, such as an Internet
Framework Convention. This convention would include a unique multistakeholder model of participation
and responsibility, aiming to establish a comprehensive legal framework for Internet governance. These
proposals offer a potential future research direction for the development of IIL and the effective regulation
of cyberspace.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Despite the growing recognition of the need for international Internet law, there are several knowledge
gaps that require further research. Firstly, there is a need to address the challenges posed by cyber-security,
jurisdiction, and privacy protection in the context of IIL. Understanding how these issues intersect with
international legal frameworks is essential for effective Internet governance.
Additionally, more research is needed to explore the feasibility and practicality of implementing the due
diligence principle in cyberspace. Clarifying the parameters and obligations of states under this principle
will help establish a more robust framework for state responsibility in the context of cyber threats.
Furthermore, the relationship between soft law and hard law in the development of IIL requires further
investigation. Understanding how soft law norms and guidelines can complement and inform hard-law
measures will contribute to the creation of a comprehensive and effective legal framework for Internet
governance.
Lastly, future research should focus on the implementation and potential challenges associated with the
proposed hard-law measures, such as the Internet Framework Convention. Evaluating the practicality and
effectiveness of these proposals will be crucial for shaping the future of international Internet law.

## Conclusion

This literature review highlights the importance of developing a comprehensive framework for international Internet law to address the challenges posed by the Internet. By synthesizing the provided research
findings, it becomes evident that the application of the due diligence principle and the role of soft law
are crucial considerations in this field. The proposed hard-law measures, such as the Internet Framework
Convention, offer potential future research directions. However, there are knowledge gaps that require
further exploration, including cyber-security, jurisdiction, and privacy protection. Addressing these gaps

and evaluating the feasibility of implementing state responsibility in cyberspace will contribute to the
effective regulation of the Internet and the advancement of international Internet law.
