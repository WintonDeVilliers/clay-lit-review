# Literature Review: Cyber Threat Intelligence for SMEs

## Introduction

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has become a critical aspect of organizations' efforts to counter the rise
of cyber-attacks. With the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber threats, SMEs (Small and
Medium-sized Enterprises) also need effective CTI solutions to protect their systems and assets. This
literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the research findings related to CTI for
SMEs. The integration and synthesis of these findings will help identify knowledge gaps and suggest
potential future research directions in this field.

## CTI and Its Importance

CTI plays a crucial role in enabling organizations to anticipate, detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber
threats effectively. Liao et al. (2016) emphasize the significance of CTI in discovering and analyzing
open-source cyber threat intelligence, which aids in understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures
employed by adversaries [^1^]. Furthermore, Hoglund (2014) highlights that CTI is being considered
by many organizations to counter the advanced persistent threat (APT) [^2^]. This indicates that SMEs
should also prioritize CTI to enhance their cybersecurity posture.

## Challenges and Opportunities in CTI

Conti et al. (2018) highlight that the Department of Defense has not developed a secure communication
network or certification standards for secure smart devices [^3^]. This gap suggests that there is a
need for research and development of secure communication networks and standards for smart devices
used by SMEs. Abu et al. (2018) discuss the challenges faced in CTI, including the lack of expertise,
limited resources, and inadequate information sharing mechanisms [^4^]. Addressing these challenges
and developing effective information sharing mechanisms can significantly improve CTI capabilities for
SMEs.

## Log-based Cyber Threat Hunting

Mansfield et al. (2013) emphasize the importance of log-based cyber threat hunting as a solution to counter
sophisticated attacks [^5^]. This approach enables proactive detection and response to cyber threats by
analyzing system logs. Integrating log-based threat hunting techniques into CTI solutions can enhance
SMEs' ability to identify and mitigate potential threats.

## Malware Detection and Cybersecurity

Sillaber et al. (2016) highlight the increasing importance of malware detection in cybersecurity operations
[^6^]. Detecting and analyzing malware samples can provide valuable insights into the techniques used
by adversaries and help develop effective countermeasures. Therefore, SMEs should focus on developing
robust malware detection capabilities as part of their CTI strategies.

## Fake CTI and Subversion of Defense Systems

Adversaries can exploit fake CTI examples to subvert cyber defense systems [^7^]. Gao et al. (2020)
discuss the use of fake CTI as training input to deceive cyber defense systems and propose techniques
for efficient cyber threat hunting using CTI [^8^]. This research finding highlights the need for SMEs
to validate the authenticity and reliability of CTI sources and develop advanced techniques to detect and
mitigate fake CTI.

## Information Sharing for Defense Against Cyber Threats

Effective information sharing is crucial for organizations to defend against cyber threats. Jahromi et al.
(2020) emphasize the importance of sharing CTI as part of multi-layered defense tools [^9^]. Collaborative sharing of CTI among SMEs can enhance their collective ability to detect and respond to cyber
threats effectively.

## Securing Wearable Devices

With the increasing popularity of wearable devices, securing these devices is vital for protecting user
data and preventing cyber-attacks. Fransen et al. (2015) highlight the need for cyber security information
exchange to gain insights into the effects of cyber threats on wearable devices [^10^]. SMEs should
prioritize the development of security mechanisms and protocols specific to wearable devices to ensure
their protection against cyber threats.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the research findings related
to CTI for SMEs. The integration and synthesis of these findings highlight the importance of CTI, the
challenges and opportunities in its implementation, the significance of log-based cyber threat hunting,
the need for robust malware detection, the risks associated with fake CTI, the importance of information
sharing, and the need for securing wearable devices. The identified knowledge gaps and potential future
research directions include the development of secure communication networks and standards for smart
devices, addressing the challenges in CTI implementation for SMEs, improving information sharing
mechanisms, detecting and mitigating fake CTI, and developing security mechanisms specific to wearable
devices. Future research in these areas can significantly contribute to enhancing the CTI capabilities of
SMEs and improving their cybersecurity posture.
