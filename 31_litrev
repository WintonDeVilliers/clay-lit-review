# Literature Review: Towards Defining Industry 5.0 Vision with Intelligent and Softwarized Wireless

Network Architectures and Services: A Survey

## Introduction

The rapid advancement in wireless network technologies has led to the emergence of Industry 5.0, which
aims to integrate intelligent and softwarized wireless network architectures and services into various
industries. This literature review explores the potential of Industry 5.0 and the role of advanced wireless
network technologies in its realization. The review synthesizes relevant research findings and highlights
knowledge gaps that require further investigation.

## Integration of 6G Wireless Networks with Advanced Architectures and Networks

The integration of 6G wireless networks with advanced architectures and networks, such as software-defined networks (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and cloud/fog computing, is crucial for
the realization of Industry 5.0. Zeb et al. (2022) discuss the potential use cases of 6G networks in smart
healthcare and Industry 5.0. They emphasize the need for intelligent next-generation (NextG) wireless
networks as technological enablers for Industry 5.0. These networks can leverage advanced architectures
and networks to provide efficient and reliable wireless communication services.

## Challenges and Requirements of 6G Networks

The deployment of 6G networks poses several challenges and requires specific requirements to meet
the demands of Industry 5.0. Akbar et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive survey on the challenges,
requirements, applications, key enabling technologies, use cases, AI integration issues, and security
aspects of 6G networks. They highlight the need for efficient AI integration and security mechanisms
to ensure the reliable operation of 6G networks in Industry 5.0 environments.

## Potential Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Industry 5.0

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential for various applications in Industry 5.0.
A study by [Anonymous] proposes a system called iSALSA, which utilizes UAVs for automated site
surveys in rugged environments to design industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networking solutions. The
iSALSA system also enables pre-deployment simulation and validation of access points (APs), improving

the safety and security of field engineers and solution architects.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Although the research findings discussed above shed light on the integration of advanced wireless network
technologies in Industry 5.0, there are still some knowledge gaps that require further investigation. These
knowledge gaps include:

1. **Security and Privacy:** While Akbar et al. (2022) briefly touch upon security aspects of 6G networks,
   further research is needed to explore robust security mechanisms and privacy-preserving techniques for
   Industry 5.0 environments.
2. **Network Management and Optimization:** The integration of SDN and NFV in 6G networks
   opens up new possibilities for network management and optimization. Future research should focus
   on developing intelligent algorithms and techniques to efficiently manage and optimize the softwarized
   wireless network architectures in Industry 5.0.
3. **Energy Efficiency:** As Industry 5.0 relies heavily on wireless communication, energy-efficient
   wireless network architectures and services are essential. Future research should explore energy-efficient
   design principles and techniques to minimize the energy consumption of wireless networks in Industry
   5.0.
4. **Quality of Service (QoS):** Industry 5.0 applications, such as real-time monitoring and control
   systems, require stringent QoS guarantees. Further research is needed to develop QoS-aware mechanisms
   and protocols to ensure reliable and timely delivery of data in Industry 5.0 wireless networks.
5. **Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI):** While AI integration is mentioned in the survey by Akbar
   et al. (2022), additional research is required to explore the full potential of AI in Industry 5.0. Future
   studies should investigate AI-driven solutions for intelligent resource allocation, anomaly detection, and
   predictive maintenance in wireless networks.
   In conclusion, the integration of intelligent and softwarized wireless network architectures and services is
   crucial for the realization of Industry 5.0. The research findings discussed in this literature review highlight
   the potential of 6G networks, advanced architectures, and technologies like SDN, NFV, and UAVs.
   However, there are several knowledge gaps that require further investigation, including security, network
   management, energy efficiency, QoS, and AI integration. Future research should focus on addressing these
   gaps to pave the way for the successful implementation of Industry 5.0.
