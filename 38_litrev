# Literature Review: Does Privacy Breach Affect Firm Performance?

## Introduction

In recent years, the privacy of individuals' personal information has become a growing concern for
organizations. While previous studies have extensively analyzed the impact of cybersecurity breaches on
firm performance, the impact of privacy breaches on firm performance is relatively less explored. This
literature review aims to synthesize the provided research findings to understand the relationship between
privacy breach and firm performance. Specifically, we will examine the impact of information security
breaches on stock market returns of firms and the consumer concerns about information privacy.

## Impact of Information Security Breaches on Stock Market Returns

Gordon, Loeb, and Zhou (2011) conducted a study to analyze the impact of information security breaches
on stock market returns of firms. The authors found that such breaches have a significant impact on stock
market returns. Additionally, they observed that breaches of availability, i.e., when information becomes
inaccessible to authorized users, had the greatest negative effect on stock market returns. This finding
suggests that the loss of availability resulting from privacy breaches can significantly harm the financial
performance of firms. The study provides valuable insights into the detrimental consequences of privacy
breaches on the stock market performance of organizations.
Furthermore, Gordon et al. (2011) discovered an interesting trend related to the impact of security breaches
after the 9/11 attacks. They found that the impact of security breaches decreased following the 9/11 attacks.
This finding suggests that the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks may have influenced the perception
of security breaches and their impact on firm performance. However, the study does not delve deeper
into the reasons behind this decrease in impact. Future research could focus on exploring the factors that
contributed to the decrease in impact and further investigate the relationship between major events and
the consequences of privacy breaches on firm performance.

## Consumer Concerns and Information Sensitivity Typology

Milne, Pettinico, Hajjat, and Markos (2017) conducted research to advance the understanding of consumer
concerns about information privacy. They developed an information sensitivity typology to map the degree
and type of risk that consumers perceive in personal data sharing. This typology categorizes different types
of personal information based on their perceived risk levels. By doing so, the study provides a framework
for understanding the varying concerns of consumers when it comes to sharing their personal data.

The typology developed by Milne et al. (2017) is a significant contribution to the literature as it enables
researchers and organizations to better understand the factors that influence consumer perceptions of
information privacy. By identifying the different types of personal information and their associated risks,
organizations can tailor their privacy practices and policies to address specific concerns effectively. This
understanding is crucial in mitigating the negative impacts of privacy breaches on firm performance and
maintaining the trust of consumers.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings shed light on the impact of privacy breach on firm performance and
consumer concerns about information privacy, there are still several knowledge gaps that warrant further
investigation.
Firstly, the study by Gordon et al. (2011) highlights the significant negative impact of breaches of
availability on stock market returns. However, it does not explore the potential mechanisms through
which these breaches affect firm performance. Future research could focus on understanding the specific
channels through which breaches of availability lead to financial losses for organizations. This could
include investigating the impact on customer trust, reputation, and customer churn rates.
Secondly, the study by Gordon et al. (2011) mentions a decrease in the impact of security breaches after
the 9/11 attacks but does not provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying reasons. Future research could
delve into this aspect and examine the role of major events in shaping the perception and consequences
of privacy breaches. This could involve analyzing the influence of media coverage, public sentiment, and
regulatory changes following major events.
Lastly, while Milne et al. (2017) develop an information sensitivity typology, their study primarily focuses
on consumer perceptions and does not directly examine the impact of privacy breaches on firm performance. Future research could bridge this gap by exploring the relationship between consumer concerns
about information privacy and their subsequent behaviors, such as changes in purchasing patterns, loyalty,
and engagement with organizations. Understanding these relationships can provide valuable insights into
the long-term consequences of privacy breaches on firm performance.
In conclusion, the literature review highlights the significant impact of privacy breaches on firm performance, specifically in terms of stock market returns. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding
consumer concerns about information privacy and the development of typologies to categorize different
types of personal information based on perceived risk. However, there are still knowledge gaps regarding
the mechanisms through which breaches affect firm performance, the influence of major events on breach
consequences, and the relationship between consumer concerns and firm-level outcomes. Addressing

these gaps through future research can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of
privacy breach on firm performance and inform effective strategies to mitigate its negative consequences.
