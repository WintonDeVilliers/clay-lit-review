# Literature Review: A Preliminary Study on Artificial Intelligence Oracles and Smart Contracts: A Legal Approach to the Interaction of Two Novel Technological Breakthroughs

## Introduction

The advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution has brought forth two cutting-edge technological achieve- ments: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Smart Contracts. These innovations have had a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, including transactions. This literature review aims to explore the legal aspects of the interaction between AI oracles and smart contracts, focusing on their implications, challenges, and potential future directions.

## AI Oracles and Smart Contracts

AI oracles play a crucial role in facilitating the integration of AI and smart contracts. They serve
as intermediaries between AI systems and smart contracts, enabling the exchange of information and decision-making processes. Several studies have explored the integration of AI oracles and smart contracts in different domains.
Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a distributed framework for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in smart contract-based Blockchain-IoT systems. They leveraged fog computing to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time. The integration of fog computing and AI oracles has the potential to enhance the security and resilience of smart contract-based systems [^1].
Raja et al. (2020) presented an AI-powered blockchain protocol for secure multiparty computation in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Their protocol utilized AI oracles to enable decentralized secure computation and enhance privacy in vehicular networks. This study demonstrates the potential of AI oracles in ensuring secure and privacy-preserving transactions [^2].
Wang et al. (2022) introduced the concept of metaverses and DeMetaverses, which involve the integration of digital twins in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and parallel intelligence in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). The use of AI oracles and smart contracts can enable efficient coordination and decision-making in these complex systems. This research highlights the need for legal frameworks to govern the interactions between AI oracles and smart contracts in CPS and CPSS [^3].
Moulahi et al. (2022) proposed a privacy-preserving federated learning approach for cyber-threat detection in intelligent transport systems. Their approach utilized blockchain-based security and AI oracles to enable

collaborative threat detection while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. This study emphasizes the importance of legal frameworks for ensuring data protection and privacy in AI oracle-enabled systems [^4].

## Legal Implications and Challenges

The integration of AI oracles and smart contracts raises various legal implications and challenges that need to be addressed.
Armitage et al. (2017) argue that the innovative nature of AI and smart contracts calls for a new approach to regulation. They propose a design-thinking approach to bridge the gap between innovation and regulation. This approach involves iterative and collaborative processes that consider legal, ethical, and societal implications from the early stages of technology development. This research highlights the importance of proactive legal frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI oracles and smart contracts [^5].
Ding et al. (2021) explored the concept of parallel governance for Decentralized Autonomous Organiza- tions (DAOs) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts. They emphasize the need for legal frameworks to govern the interactions between AI oracles, smart contracts, and DAOs. This research suggests that legal frameworks should address issues such as liability, accountability, and dispute resolution in DAOs [^6].
Beck et al. (2022) propose a multi-perspective framework for researching sustainable autonomous systems. They highlight the need for legal frameworks that consider environmental, social, and economic aspects of AI oracle and smart contract-enabled systems. This research calls for comprehensive legal frameworks that promote sustainability and responsible innovation in the context of AI oracles and smart contracts [^7].
Bhawana and Kumar (2021) reviewed the possibilities and challenges of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) based on blockchain. They emphasize the importance of legal frameworks in ensuring the security, privacy, and interoperability of CPS enabled by AI oracles and smart contracts. This study highlights the need for legal frameworks that address the unique challenges of CPS and promote trust and transparency in AI oracle-enabled systems [^8].

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While existing research has shed light on the legal aspects of the interaction between AI oracles and smart contracts, there are still several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Future research should focus on the following areas:

1. **Regulatory Frameworks**: Further research is needed to develop comprehensive regulatory frame- works that govern the use of AI oracles and smart contracts. These frameworks should address legal issues related to liability, accountability, data protection, privacy, and dispute resolution.
2. **Ethical Considerations**: Future research should explore the ethical implications of AI oracle-en- abled smart contracts. This includes issues such as fairness, transparency, bias, and accountability in decision-making processes.
3. **Interoperability**: Research should investigate legal frameworks that promote interoperability between different AI oracles and smart contracts. This will enable seamless integration and collaboration between various systems and stakeholders.
4. **Data Governance**: Future research should explore legal frameworks for data governance in AI oracle-enabled systems. This includes issues related to data ownership, data sharing, and data protection.
5. **International Cooperation**: Given the global nature of AI oracles and smart contracts, future research should focus on international cooperation and the harmonization of legal frameworks across different jurisdictions.
6. **Sustainability**: Further research is needed to develop legal frameworks that promote sustainability in AI oracle-enabled systems. This includes addressing the environmental and social impacts and ensuring responsible innovation.
   In conclusion, the integration of AI oracles and smart contracts presents new opportunities and challenges in various domains. Legal frameworks play a crucial role in ensuring the responsible and ethical use
   of these technologies. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive legal frameworks
   that address the regulatory, ethical, interoperability, data governance, international cooperation, and sustainability aspects of AI oracle-enabled smart contracts.
