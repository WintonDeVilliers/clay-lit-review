# Literature Review

## Introduction

Insurance pricing for risks associated with information technology systems is a complex challenge that
requires integrating the disciplines of operations management, security, and economics. This literature
review aims to explore the existing research findings related to the development of a socioeconomic
modelling framework for cyber-insurance decisions. The framework encompasses entity relationship
diagrams, security maturity models, and economic models, aiming to address the challenge of capturing
organizational structure in the design and pricing of cyber-insurance policies. Additionally, the review
will highlight knowledge gaps and propose potential future research directions.

## Cyber-Insurance and Pricing

Insurance pricing is typically based on the historical data and experience of insurance companies regarding
the frequency and magnitude of losses in organizations based on factors such as size, industry sector, and
location [^1^]. However, cyber-insurance presents a unique challenge due to limited data history [^1^].
This limitation necessitates the development of innovative modelling frameworks that can accurately
capture the complexities of cyber risks and organizational structures.

## Socioeconomic Modelling Framework

The proposed socioeconomic modelling framework for cyber-insurance decisions combines entity relationship diagrams, security maturity models, and economic models [^1^]. The entity relationship
diagrams provide a visual representation of the relationships and dependencies between entities within an
organization, including IT systems, processes, and stakeholders [^2^]. By incorporating these diagrams
into the modelling framework, it becomes possible to assess the impact of cyber risks on different
components of the organization and develop appropriate insurance policies.
Security maturity models, on the other hand, enable organizations to evaluate and improve their cybersecurity capabilities [^2^]. By including security maturity models in the framework, insurers can assess
the cybersecurity readiness of potential policyholders and adjust insurance premiums accordingly. This
ensures that organizations with higher cybersecurity maturity receive more favorable pricing, encouraging
investments in cybersecurity measures.

Economic models form an integral part of the socioeconomic modelling framework as they provide the
foundation for pricing cyber-insurance policies [^1^]. These models consider various factors such as
the potential financial losses from cyber incidents, the cost of implementing security measures, and the
market demand for cyber-insurance. By incorporating economic models into the framework, insurers can
calculate accurate premiums that reflect the actual risks and costs associated with cyber risks.

## Integration and Synthesis of Research Findings

Various research findings contribute to the development of the proposed socioeconomic modelling
framework for cyber-insurance decisions. Chetty et al. (2020) emphasize the importance of incorporating
private sector data and experience into economic analyses [^1^]. This finding aligns with the inclusion
of economic models in the framework, which rely on historical data and industry insights to determine
insurance premiums.
Eppinger and Browning (2012) provide insights into the use of design structure matrix methods for
managing complex systems, which can be applied to the development of entity relationship diagrams
within the framework [^2^]. This research finding highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding
of an organization's structure and dependencies to accurately model the impact of cyber risks.
Skelcher and Smith (2014) contribute to the framework by emphasizing the significance of institutional
logics and actor identities in hybrid organizations [^3^]. This insight can be incorporated into the entity
relationship diagrams to capture the different perspectives and motivations of stakeholders within an
organization, thus enabling a more nuanced assessment of cyber risks.
Cole, Stevenson, and Aitken (2019) discuss the implications of blockchain technology for supply chain
management, which can be relevant to the design and pricing of cyber-insurance policies [^4^]. The
integration of blockchain technology into the framework can enhance transparency and trust in insurance
transactions, enabling more accurate pricing and claims settlement processes.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the proposed socioeconomic modelling framework for cyber-insurance decisions addresses the
challenge of capturing organizational structure, there are still several knowledge gaps that present
opportunities for future research. First, the framework could benefit from further research on the specific
factors that contribute to the pricing of cyber-insurance policies. This research could explore how different
organizational characteristics, such as industry sector, organizational size, and geographic location, affect

insurance premiums.
Second, there is a need for research on the development of more sophisticated security maturity models.
These models should consider not only technical cybersecurity capabilities but also organizational culture,
employee awareness, and governance mechanisms. Integrating these factors into the framework would
enable insurers to better assess an organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and tailor insurance
premiums accordingly.
Third, future research should explore the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, into the socioeconomic modelling framework. These technologies can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of risk assessment and pricing processes, enabling insurers to provide
more customized and cost-effective cyber-insurance policies.
Lastly, there is a need for empirical studies that validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
in real-world settings. These studies should assess the framework's ability to accurately capture organizational structure, evaluate cybersecurity maturity, and determine appropriate insurance premiums. By
conducting such studies, researchers can validate the framework's effectiveness and identify potential
areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the pricing of insurance for risks associated with information technology systems requires
a comprehensive modelling framework that integrates operations management, security, and economics.
The proposed socioeconomic modelling framework, which incorporates entity relationship diagrams,
security maturity models, and economic models, addresses the challenge of capturing organizational
structure in the design and pricing of cyber-insurance policies. However, further research is needed to
explore the specific factors influencing insurance pricing, develop sophisticated security maturity models,
integrate emerging technologies, and validate the effectiveness of the framework in real-world settings.
By addressing these knowledge gaps, researchers can contribute to the advancement of cyber-insurance
pricing and facilitate the development of more accurate and tailored insurance policies.
