# Literature Review: Cyber-risk Perception and Prioritization for Decision-Making and Threat Intelli- gence

## Introduction

Proactive cyber-risk assessment is becoming increasingly important in various sectors to prevent cyber-in- cidents and enhance the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. In this literature review, we explore the topic of cyber-risk perception and prioritization for decision-making and threat intelligence. We aim to understand the current research landscape, identify key findings, and highlight knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research.

## Statistical Framework for Prioritization of Cyber-vulnerabilities

One of the key research findings in this domain is the introduction of a statistical framework for the prioritization of cyber-vulnerabilities. This framework utilizes robust and interpretable regression models to support decision-making [Abstract 1]. Traditional black box machine learning models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), are powerful predictors but lack interpretability [Abstract 4]. Interpretable models provide insights into how decisions are made, which is crucial for understanding cyber-risk perception and prioritization.

## Interpretable Decision Sets for Description and Prediction

The concept of interpretable decision sets has been proposed as a joint framework for description and prediction in the context of cyber-risk perception and prioritization [Abstract 2]. This framework allows decision-makers to understand and interpret the factors influencing cyber-risk perception and prioritize vulnerabilities accordingly. By combining description and prediction, decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of cyber-risk perception.

## Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling for Policy and Decision Making

Machine learning and statistical modeling techniques have been applied to analyze cyber hate speech
on Twitter and support policy and decision-making processes [Abstract 3]. These techniques enable the identification and classification of cyber hate speech, providing valuable insights for policy-makers. By leveraging machine learning and statistical modeling, decision-makers can make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to mitigate cyber risks.

## Cybersecurity Incident Prediction and Data-driven Approaches

Data-driven approaches, such as predictive modeling, have been widely used for cybersecurity incident

prediction [Abstract 9]. By analyzing network, system, and process data, these approaches can detect and predict cyber-attacks in industrial control systems. However, there is a need for further research to develop more robust and accurate prediction models that can handle the complexity and dynamic nature of cyber threats.

## Challenges of Intelligibility in Black Box Models

While black box models like deep neural networks achieve high accuracy in prediction tasks, they lack intelligibility [Abstract 4]. It is crucial to understand how decisions are made in cyber-risk perception and prioritization to ensure transparency and accountability. Research on interpretable classification models can provide insights into the decision-making process and address the challenges posed by black box models.

## Algorithm-in-the-Loop Decision Making

The principles and limits of algorithm-in-the-loop decision-making have been explored in the context of cyber-risk perception and prioritization [Abstract 8]. Decision-making processes that involve algorithms require careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of the algorithms used. Understanding how algorithms influence decision-making can help in developing more effective and trustworthy decision support systems.

## Trust Computational Model for IoT Services

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), trust computational models based on machine learning have been proposed to support decision-making in IoT services [Abstract 12]. These models enable decision-makers to assess the trustworthiness of IoT services and make informed decisions. Further research is needed
to develop more accurate and robust trust computational models that can handle the complexity and heterogeneity of IoT environments.

## Consensus in Group Decision Making

Large-scale group decision-making in social networks requires consensus among participants. The con- cept of minimum cost model based on robust optimization has been proposed to achieve consensus in group decision-making [Abstract 14]. This model provides a framework for overcoming differences in opinions and achieving agreement among participants. Future research can focus on applying this model to cyber-risk perception and prioritization in social networks.

## Conclusion

This literature review provides an overview of the current research on cyber-risk perception and prioriti- zation for decision-making and threat intelligence. The findings highlight the importance of interpretable models, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing cyber risks. However, there are several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research, such as developing more accurate and robust prediction models, understanding the challenges of black box models, and exploring the role of algorithms in decision-making processes. By addressing these gaps, researchers can contribute to the development of effective cyber-risk management strategies and decision support systems.
