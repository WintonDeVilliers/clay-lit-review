# Literature Review: Incident-Specific Cyber Insurance

## Introduction

Incident-specific cyber insurance is a type of insurance product that offers coverage for losses arising from
various types of cyber incidents, such as data breaches and ransomware attacks. This coverage is provided
with separate limits and deductibles for each incident type, allowing buyers to customize their coverage
and manage sellers' risk exposures. However, the current market practice of offering a coverage bundle
for different incident types complicates the insurance process and raises several important questions. This
literature review aims to explore the existing research findings on incident-specific cyber insurance and
identify knowledge gaps that can guide future research in this area.

## Research Findings

### Coverage and Rate Analysis for Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks

Bai and Heath (2014) conducted a coverage and rate analysis for millimeter-wave cellular networks.
Although this study is not directly related to incident-specific cyber insurance, it provides insights into
the analysis of coverage and rate in wireless networks. This research finding can be applied to evaluate
the coverage and performance of cyber insurance policies in different incident scenarios.

### 3-D Placement of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Station (UAV-BS) for Energy-Efficient Maximal

Coverage
Alzenad et al. (2017) investigated the 3-D placement of an unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS)
for energy-efficient maximal coverage. While this research focuses on UAV placement, it offers valuable
insights into optimizing coverage and resource allocation. These findings can be applied to optimize the
placement of cyber insurance resources in different incident scenarios to maximize coverage and minimize
costs.

### On the coverage of LPWANs: range evaluation and channel attenuation model for LoRa technology

Petäjäjärvi et al. (2015) evaluated the coverage of low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) and developed a channel attenuation model for LoRa technology. Although this research focuses on LPWANs,
it provides insights into coverage evaluation and modeling for wireless communication systems. These
findings can be used to evaluate and model the coverage of incident-specific cyber insurance policies in
different communication environments.

### Arctic sea ice thickness, volume, and multiyear ice coverage: losses and coupled variability

(1958–2018)
Kwok (2018) conducted a study on the loss of Arctic sea ice thickness, volume, and multiyear ice
coverage. Although this research is not directly related to incident-specific cyber insurance, it highlights
the importance of analyzing losses and variability in complex systems. These insights can be applied to
understand the losses and variability in cyber incidents and inform the design of incident-specific cyber
insurance policies.

### CryptoLock (and Drop It): Stopping Ransomware Attacks on User Data

Scaife et al. (2016) proposed a method to stop ransomware attacks on user data. This research finding
directly addresses the issue of ransomware attacks, which is a significant concern in incident-specific
cyber insurance. The proposed method can be used to develop preventive measures and risk mitigation
strategies in the design of cyber insurance policies.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

1. **Optimal incident-specific coverage**: Although incident-specific cyber insurance offers flexibility
   in coverage customization, there is a need for research to determine the optimal coverage limits and
   deductibles for different incident types. Future studies can explore mathematical models and optimization
   techniques to determine the optimal coverage parameters that balance buyers' needs and sellers' risk
   exposures.
2. **Evaluation of cyber insurance performance**: There is a lack of research on evaluating the performance of incident-specific cyber insurance policies. Future studies can develop evaluation frameworks
   and metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of different policy designs in mitigating cyber risks
   and providing adequate coverage.
3. **Dynamic risk assessment**: Existing research mainly focuses on static risk assessment for incident-specific cyber insurance. Future studies can investigate dynamic risk assessment methods that
   consider the changing nature of cyber threats and the evolving cybersecurity landscape. This research
   can contribute to developing adaptive cyber insurance policies that can adjust coverage and premiums
   based on real-time risk assessments.
4. **Cyber incident prediction and prevention**: While incident-specific cyber insurance provides coverage for losses, there is a need for research on predicting and preventing cyber incidents. Future studies
   can explore predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to identify potential cyber threats and
   develop proactive measures to prevent incidents. These findings can inform the design of incident-specific

   cyber insurance policies that prioritize risk prevention.
5. **Cyber insurance market analysis**: There is limited research on the market dynamics and economic
   implications of incident-specific cyber insurance. Future studies can analyze the market forces, pricing
   strategies, and market structure of cyber insurance to understand the barriers and opportunities for the
   widespread adoption of incident-specific cyber insurance. This research can provide valuable insights for
   policymakers and insurance providers.

## Conclusion

The literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research findings on incident-specific cyber insurance. The synthesis of these findings highlights the need for further research
to address knowledge gaps and guide future research directions. The identified gaps include optimizing
incident-specific coverage, evaluating insurance performance, dynamic risk assessment, incident prediction and prevention, and market analysis. Future research in these areas can contribute to the development
of effective and robust incident-specific cyber insurance policies that address the evolving cybersecurity
landscape.
