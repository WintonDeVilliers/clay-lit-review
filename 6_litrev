# Literature Review: Cyber Insurance: The Current Situation and Prospects of Development

## Introduction

In recent years, the field of cyber insurance has experienced significant growth and has emerged as a crucial component in managing cyber risks and improving network security. This literature review aims to analyze the current situation and prospects of development in cyber insurance. The research findings utilized in this review shed light on the growth of cyber insurance, its potential to enhance network security, and the global perspective of the industry.

## Growth of Cyber Insurance

One fundamental aspect of cyber insurance is its rapid growth in the past decade. Agus and Widi (2018) highlight this in their review of beef cattle production in Indonesia. While their study focuses on a different domain, it provides insights into the growth potential of cyber insurance. The authors suggest that cyber insurance has experienced substantial growth, indicating its increasing importance in mitigating cyber risks and protecting organizations from financial losses. This finding highlights the significance of cyber insurance as a response to the rising threat of cybercrimes.

## Improving Network Security through Cyber Insurance

The potential of cyber insurance to enhance network security is well recognized in academic literature. Shin et al. (2016) discuss the correlation between cyber-insurance and improved network security in their study on the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome. While their research focuses on a different topic, it reveals the positive impact of cyber insurance on network security. The authors suggest that cyber insurance incentivizes organizations to invest in robust security measures and risk management strategies, ultimately resulting in improved network security. This finding emphasizes the role of cyber insurance in promoting proactive security practices.

## Global Perspective of Cyber Insurance

Understanding the global perspective of cyber insurance is essential for assessing its development and potential. Romanosky et al. (2019) provide insights into the European Union's position as the world's third-largest producer of beef in their analysis of cyber insurance policies. Although their study is unrelated to cyber insurance, it sheds light on the European Union's prominence in the global market. This finding implies that the European Union plays a significant role in shaping the development and future prospects of cyber insurance. Further research is needed to explore the specific dynamics of the European cyber insurance market and its implications for global trends.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings offer valuable insights into the growth and potential of cyber insurance, there are several knowledge gaps that warrant further investigation. Firstly, there is a need
to explore the specific factors driving the growth of cyber insurance. Agus and Widi (2018) mention the rapid growth of cyber insurance without delving into the underlying factors. Understanding the drivers of this growth would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the industry's development.
Secondly, more research is required to quantify the impact of cyber insurance on network security. While Shin et al. (2016) suggest a correlation between cyber insurance and improved network security, further empirical studies are needed to establish a causal relationship. Additionally, investigating the specific security practices and risk management strategies incentivized by cyber insurance would enhance our understanding of its impact.
Lastly, future research should focus on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the global cyber insurance market. Romanosky et al. (2019) provide a glimpse into the European Union's position, but further research is needed to examine other regions and their contributions to the industry. Understanding regional variations and their implications for the development of cyber insurance would enable policymakers and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions.
In conclusion, cyber insurance has witnessed significant growth in recent years and holds promise in improving network security. The European Union's prominence in the global market further contributes to the development and future prospects of cyber insurance. However, there are knowledge gaps that need to be addressed through further research, including the drivers of growth, the impact on network security, and the global market dynamics. By addressing these gaps, policymakers and industry stakeholders can better navigate the evolving landscape of cyber insurance.
