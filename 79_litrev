# Literature Review: Intelligent Manufacturing Eco-system: A Post COVID-19 Recovery and Growth

Opportunity for Manufacturing Industry in Sub-Saharan Countries

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted various sectors, including the manufacturing industry, globally.
In Sub-Saharan countries, the manufacturing industry has faced severe challenges due to the pandemic.
However, it also presents an opportunity for recovery and growth through the adoption of intelligent
manufacturing practices. This literature review aims to explore the potential of intelligent manufacturing
as a post-COVID-19 recovery and growth opportunity for the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan
countries.

## Impact of COVID-19 on the Manufacturing Industry

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the manufacturing industry. Manufacturing
operations were disrupted due to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and supply chain interruptions. This led
to a decline in production, reduced demand, and financial losses for companies (Cai & Luo, 2020). The
manufacturing industry needs to adapt and find new ways to recover and grow in the post-pandemic era.

## Role of Intelligent Manufacturing in Post-COVID-19 Recovery

Intelligent manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0 or smart manufacturing, involves the integration of
advanced technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, to enhance manufacturing processes and productivity (Rahman et al., 2021). The adoption of intelligent manufacturing
practices can provide several benefits to the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan countries, enabling
them to recover and grow in the post-COVID-19 era.

## Service Robots in the Healthcare Sector

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of service robots in the healthcare
sector. Service robots have been utilized to overcome the difficulties and hardships caused by the virus,
including reducing human-to-human contact and providing assistance in hospitals and healthcare facilities
(Shen et al., 2021). The integration of service robots in the manufacturing industry can play a crucial role
in ensuring the safety and efficiency of production processes.

## Readiness of Italian Regions for Industry 4.0

A study conducted in Italy assessed the readiness and responsiveness of Italian regions in adopting
Industry 4.0 practices to accelerate sustainable manufacturing in the COVID-19 era. The findings revealed

regional disparities in terms of readiness and responsiveness, indicating the need for targeted interventions
and support to promote the adoption of intelligent manufacturing practices (Lepore et al., 2021). Similar
assessments can be conducted in Sub-Saharan countries to identify regional variations and develop
tailored strategies for post-pandemic recovery.

## High-Growth Entrepreneurial Firms in Africa

Research on high-growth entrepreneurial firms in Africa suggests that these firms play a crucial role in
driving economic growth and job creation. However, the study also revealed the presence of constraints
and challenges, such as limited access to finance, technological resources, and skilled labor (Goedhuys &
Sleuwaegen, 2010). Intelligent manufacturing can provide opportunities for high-growth entrepreneurial
firms to overcome these constraints and enhance their competitiveness in the post-COVID-19 era.

## Structural Transformation in Developing Countries

The concept of structural transformation, from "Flying Geese" to "Leading Dragons," highlights new
opportunities and strategies for developing countries to achieve sustainable economic growth. The adoption of intelligent manufacturing practices can contribute to this structural transformation by enabling
Sub-Saharan countries to move up the value chain, enhance productivity, and compete in the global market
(Lin, 2011).

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings shed light on the potential of intelligent manufacturing as a
post-COVID-19 recovery and growth opportunity for the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan countries, there are several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed through future research. These include:

1. The specific challenges and opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan countries in adopting intelligent
   manufacturing practices in the post-pandemic era.
2. The role of government policies and support in facilitating the adoption of intelligent manufacturing in
   Sub-Saharan countries.
3. The impact of intelligent manufacturing on job creation and skill requirements in the manufacturing
   industry of Sub-Saharan countries.
4. The potential barriers and enablers for high-growth entrepreneurial firms in Sub-Saharan countries to
   adopt intelligent manufacturing practices.
5. The readiness and responsiveness of different sectors within the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan
   countries to embrace intelligent manufacturing.
   Future research should focus on addressing these knowledge gaps to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of intelligent manufacturing as a post-COVID-19 recovery and growth opportunity

   for the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan countries.

## Conclusion

Intelligent manufacturing presents a promising opportunity for the manufacturing industry in Sub-Saharan
countries to recover and grow in the post-COVID-19 era. By integrating advanced technologies and
practices, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, Sub-Saharan countries can
enhance their manufacturing processes, improve productivity, and compete in the global market. However,
further research is needed to address the knowledge gaps and understand the specific challenges and
opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan countries in adopting intelligent manufacturing practices. This will
enable policymakers and industry stakeholders to develop targeted strategies and interventions to leverage
the potential of intelligent manufacturing for post-pandemic recovery and growth.
