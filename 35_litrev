# Literature Review

## Introduction

The advancement and proliferation of information systems among enterprises have led to an increased
understanding of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity practices encompass a set of techniques and procedures
aimed at protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.
These practices vary and are applied differently to different types of enterprises. This literature review aims
to compare critical cybersecurity threats and practices in the context of cloud computing among micro,
small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). By conducting a survey among 289 MSMEs in Australia, the
study conducted by Tehrani and Shirazi (2014) highlights significant differences in their cloud security
practices. The findings of this review contribute to the identification of knowledge gaps and suggest
potential future research directions in the field of cybersecurity in cloud computing among MSMEs.

## Factors Influencing Cloud Computing Adoption

Several factors have been identified as influencing the adoption of cloud computing by MSMEs. Tehrani
and Shirazi (2014) found that factors related to advantaging organizational capability influence the
adoption of cloud computing technology by MSMEs. Additionally, Senarathna et al. (2018) highlight that
IT resources and external pressure significantly influence cloud computing adoption in Malaysian SMEs.
Hassan et al. (2016) further support these findings by identifying IT resources and external pressure as
factors influencing cloud computing adoption in Malaysian SMEs.
In the context of Romanian SMEs, Dinc et al. (2019) found that factors such as competition and
government, ICT providers and firm departments, employees, managers, and technological factors play
a significant role in the choice of adopting cloud computing technology. Furthermore, Asiaei and Rahim
(2019) identify data security, technology readiness, top management support, competitive pressure, and
innovativeness as the most significant factors in predicting the adoption of cloud computing in Malaysian
SMEs. Raut et al. (2019) focus specifically on the manufacturing sector and find that factors such as
hardware scalability and standardization, cost, innovation, installation and upgradation, and quality of
service significantly influence cloud computing adoption among manufacturing MSMEs.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing for SMEs

Cloud computing offers various benefits for SMEs. Kumar et al. (2017) highlight the following advantages
of cloud computing for SMEs: cost advantage, easy deployment process, easier access to the latest
information and communication technologies, automatic updates and upgrades, scalability, flexibility, and

improved disaster recovery and backup capabilities. These benefits make cloud computing an attractive
option for SMEs, as it enables them to access advanced technologies and resources without significant
upfront investments.

## Factors Affecting Cloud Computing Adoption in SMEs

Several factors have been identified as significant in the adoption of cloud computing by SMEs. Kumar
et al. (2017) found that perceived benefits, top management support, competitive pressure, and perceived
concerns play a crucial role in cloud computing adoption. Furthermore, Lutfi (2022) conducted a study
in Sabah, Malaysia, and identified cost saving, top management support, and technology readiness as
the main factors affecting cloud computing adoption by SMEs in that region. These findings emphasize
the importance of organizational support, perceived benefits, and technological readiness in driving the
adoption of cloud computing among SMEs.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Despite the growing adoption of cloud computing by MSMEs, there are still knowledge gaps that
need to be addressed. First, empirical research on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs is needed
(Semanticscholar.org). This research gap indicates the need for further investigation into cybersecurity
practices and strategies specifically tailored to the needs and capabilities of MSMEs. Second, while this
literature review focuses on the comparison of cybersecurity threats and practices in the cloud context
among MSMEs, there is a need for more in-depth studies examining the specific challenges and best
practices for cloud security in different industries and sectors.
Future research should prioritize the investigation of cybersecurity issues and practices in the context of
cloud computing, taking into account the differences among MSMEs. This includes considering factors
such as organizational capabilities, IT resources, external pressure, competition and government, ICT
providers and firm departments, employee and managerial factors, data security, technology readiness,
top management support, competitive pressure, and innovation. Additionally, research should explore the
specific benefits of cloud computing for different types of SMEs and industries, as well as the factors
influencing the adoption of cloud computing in different regions and countries.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this literature review compared critical cybersecurity threats and practices in the context of
cloud computing among MSMEs. The findings highlight the importance of organizational capabilities, IT
resources, external pressure, competition and government, ICT providers and firm departments, employee
and managerial factors, data security, technology readiness, top management support, competitive pressure, and innovation in driving the adoption of cloud computing among MSMEs. The benefits of cloud
computing for SMEs include cost advantage, easy deployment process, access to the latest technologies,

scalability, flexibility, and improved disaster recovery capabilities. However, there are still knowledge
gaps in the field, particularly regarding cybersecurity risk management in SMEs. Future research should
focus on addressing these gaps and further exploring the factors influencing cloud computing adoption
and cybersecurity practices among MSMEs.
