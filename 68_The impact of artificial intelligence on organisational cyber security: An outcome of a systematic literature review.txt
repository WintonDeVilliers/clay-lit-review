ABSTRACT
As digital transformation continues to advance, organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits
that modern technologies offer. However, with greater technology adoption comes a higher risk of cyber security
threats and attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more advanced measures to protect against constantly evolving
threats. One potential solution is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim of this research paper was to
conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to assess the impact of AI-based technologies on organisational
cyber security and determine their effectiveness compared to traditional cyber security approaches. The PRISMA
flow diagram was used to guide the review process. Peer-reviewed articles from 2018 to 2023 were included
from EBSCO Host, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest & SCOPUS and 73 remaining articles were
synthesised.
The results revealed that AI can impact cybersecurity throughout it’s entire life cycle, yielding benefits like
automation, threat intelligence, and improved cyber defense. Nevertheless, it also brings challenges like
adversarial attacks and the need for high-quality data, which could lead to the inefficiency of AI. These results
affirm the positive influence of AI on cybersecurity, enhancing effectiveness and resilience. These findings
provide a solid foundation for further research in the field of organisational cybersecurity. These results can help
organisations make informed decisions on AI implementations by offering an impartial view of its impacts.
1. Introduction
The technological revolution has led to the quick development and
acceptance of new and improved technologies. However, this has also
resulted in a rapid evolution of cyber-related threats and attacks, as
noted by Cucu (Cucu, GAVRIOLOAIA, BOLOGA, & CAZACU, 2019) and
the National Academies of Sciences (National Academies of Sciences
et al., 2019). These attacks are becoming more frequent, numerous, and
impactful. To counteract these constantly evolving threats, it is necessary to have advanced and secure cyber security measures and protective mechanisms (Wiafe et al., 2020).
Cyber security safeguards internet-facing information and communication systems against malicious attacks and threats (Li & Liu, 2021).
The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT) have expanded the scope of cyber security from network and
application security to infrastructure, cloud, and information security,
making it multi-dimensional (Yu & Guo, 2019). Cyber security encompasses various interrelated components and technologies in cyberspace
rather than just being limited to system security. In an organisational
context, cyber security involves protecting all relevant cyberspace dimensions simultaneously (Li & Liu, 2021).
The concept of “Artificial Intelligence” emerged in 1956 and has
since evolved into practical solutions used across various fields, as
highlighted by Alom (Alom et al., 2018). Machine Learning’s role in
cybersecurity dates to the 1990s with the development of anomaly
detection systems (ADS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS) (Joseph,
Laskov, Roli, Tygar, & Nelson, 2013), though progress was hindered by
data and computing limitations, as noted by (Qiu, Wu, Ding, Xu, & Feng,
2016). Today, AI is integral to cybersecurity, transcending corporate
jargon (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019) (Abbas, Ahmed, Shah, Omar, & Park,
2019). It can simulate human intelligence and behaviours, resulting in
automation in cyber security beyond human capability, which can
detect a security breach in a network within seconds (Zhang et al.,
2021). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation,
making businesses dependent on technologies like AI, Machine learning
(ML), and Big Data. However, this led to a surge in cybercrimes,
endangering individuals and established organisations. Eian (Eian,
Yong, Li, Qi, & Fatima, 2020) predicts cybercrimes could cost $10.5

trillion by 2025. Due to their reliance on these technologies, businesses
face operational and continuity risks. The use of AI in cybersecurity is
worth exploring so that organisations can understand the capabilities of
AI in the cybersecurity space for the benefit of their organisation.
Advancements in Data Science and Computer Science have led to the
emergence of ML, the most prominent type of AI in organisational cyber
security (Scott & Kyobe, 2021). Machine Learning involves a machine’s
ability to learn and adapt through experience. It is deemed a subset of AI,
and it focuses on the implementation of certain types of systems which
can learn from historical data to identify patterns and make decisions
independently (Wazid, Das, Chamola, & Park, 2022).
The vast amounts of data generated by organisations provide opportunities for a wide range of ML applications in cyberspace, including
threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and automation of cybersecurityrelated tasks (Huang & Rust, 2018). This relationship between AI and
cyber security is called cyber-AI (Abbas et al., 2019). This study aims to
look at the impact of AI on cyber-security from an organisational
perspective.
1.1. Problem statement
The implementation of AI, specifically ML solutions in cyber security, can be traced back to the late 1980’s, when the first anomaly
detection system (ADS) was implemented (Joseph et al., 2013). This was
superseded by developing an intrusion detection system (IDS) in the
1990’s. Due to the lack of structured and clean data, coupled with
limitations of computing power, its progression was delayed for a while
(Qiu et al., 2016). Today, AI has since grown to revolutionise the capabilities of modern-day technologies in cyber security (Lo et al., 2020,
p. pp129). According to (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019), implementing
AI-driven solutions in organisational cyber security has become more of
a necessity.
As digital transformation has advanced steadily in recent years, there
has been a growing reliance on the Internet and Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) (Eian et al., 2020). This has led
businesses to recognise the immense potential and significance of
modern technologies like AI, ML, and Big Data (Almeida, Santos, &
Monteiro, 2020). However, the widespread adoption of ICTs has also
resulted in an increase in cybercrimes, threats, and vulnerabilities that
target both individuals and established organisations (Zhang et al.,
2021). Since February 2020, there has been a significant surge in
cyber-related crimes and given the dependence of organisations on these
technologies, cyber threats and attacks can have dire consequences on
their operations and business continuity (Almeida et al., 2020).
In the past few years, research has been carried out to assess how AI
affects various technological environments. Malatji (Malatji, Marnewick, & von Solms, 2018) conducted a comprehensive examination of
AI’s effect on the human aspects of cybersecurity within enterprises. In a
similar study, Malatji et al. (Malatji et al., 2018) conducted a systematic
literature review, primarily aiming to examine the influence of AI on the
human aspect of information and cybersecurity. The findings suggested
that AI presently enhances human abilities and predicted a potential
transformation as AI evolves toward autonomy. Their review spanned
publications from 2008 to 2018 and specifically examined a maximum
of 12 articles per journal. The distinction between their research and the
present study lies in the focus area where the current study delves into
the broader impact of AI on organisational cybersecurity without
restricting it to the human dimension alone. Additionally, it encompasses more recent literature, and there is no predetermined limit on the
number of articles to be synthesised per journal.
In another comparable investigation conducted by De Azambuja
et al. (De Azambuja et al., 2023), their emphasis was on identifying
pertinent literature related to artificial intelligence-driven cyber-attacks
to evaluate the features of such attacks for devising cybersecurity
measures. The distinction between their research and the present study
lies in their focal point. Their literature review, confined to just two
databases, resulted in the synthesis of fewer than 30 articles. In contrast,
our current study utilises five databases, adopting a more expansive
approach to scrutinise the overall impact of AI on organisational
cybersecurity. Our objective is to unveil both the positive and negative
impact of AI, making this study more encompassing.
Harnessing AI’s evolving capabilities can be a significant advantage
for enterprises in safeguarding against cyber-attacks. Considering that
the study by (Malatji et al., 2018) was conducted five years ago, it is
worth revisiting the literature sources in line with the advancements in
the use of AI in cybersecurity hence, this study was undertaken.
Overall, the studies which have been done to date to ascertain the
impact of AI on Cybersecurity are quite scant, owing to the rapid advancements in ICT, and this paper aims to help narrow the gap.
This study aims to evaluate the impact of AI-driven technologies on
organisational cybersecurity, including their positive and negative effects, and to determine the effectiveness of Cyber-AI compared to
traditional cybersecurity measures.
The main research question that this study seeks to address is:
What is the impact of Artificial Intelligence on organisational
cybersecurity?
The following secondary research questions will be considered in
answering the primary research question:
1. What is the positive impact of AI on cyber security from an organisational perspective?
2. What is the negative impact of AI on cyber security from an organisational perspective?
3. How does the use of AI differ from traditional, non-AI-driven means
of organisational cyber security?
The remainder of this paper is arranged in the following manner:
Section 2 covers the research method, Section 3 discusses the results,
and the study concludes in Section 4.
2. Research method
This study followed a structured process for conducting a systematic
literature review, which entails planning, selection/searching and
extraction and execution (Lo et al., 2020, p. pp129; Okoli, 2015; Page
et al., 2021). The scope of the literature included searching for scholarly
literature from the following database sources: ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost, SCOPUS and ProQuest because they were deemed to contain
multi-disciplinary sources of which AI forms part (Zhang et al., 2021).
Google Scholar was also used to search for other relevant sources which
could be used to enhance this study. However, most of the articles
identified in Google Scholar were identified as duplicates and were
removed.

2.1. Inclusion & exclusion criteria
Table 1 details the inclusion criteria adhered to in identifying relevant studies for this study. The formulation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria was informed by the research questions and objectives of
this study and covered in Table 1.
Only peer-reviewed literature from conference proceedings, journal
articles and book chapters, written in English, published since
2018–2023 and were available for full access through the researcher’s
institution’s subscription, were included in this study.
2.2. Search terms
In searching for the relevant sources in the selected databases, flexible and relevant keywords and Boolean operators were used to
formulate search strings. The keywords combination was in such a
manner that focused on the research questions. Table 2 contains the
keywords and database strings used in the selected sources.
The search strings for EBSCOhost & Science Direct to search for
relevant information were the same. However, for ProQuest the initial
search strings were the same as those used for EBSCOhost and Science
Direct databases but yielded an excessive number of sources, and the
search string and the search string had to be refined to what has been
included in Table 2, which resulted in a reasonable number of search
results. SCOPUS also yielded a high number of sources with the initial
search string, and the sources which were considered were open-access
sources which met the search criteria.
The entire SLR was further guided by using the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow diagram, whose steps are explained in section 2.3. The literature search was
conducted between November 2022 and September 2023.
2.3. PRISMA flow diagram
The PRISMA flow diagram depicted in Fig. 1 was used in this study to
systematically review the selected literature, using the selected keywords and database strings included in Table 2. It consists of four
distinct stages, i.e., Identification, screening, eligibility, and synthesis,
which also covers the reporting aspect. The identification stage focuses
on identifying relevant literature sources in the chosen databases,
especially the open-access sources. In this stage, the search results
yielded 19234 combined results. In the screening phase, the articles
were screened for any potential duplicates, and this brought down the
number of records to 1814 records. Out of these records, a further 1752
were removed based on the abstract and keywords review and those
with access restrictions, which resulted in 73 articles remaining. Those
were the only remaining articles which were synthesised and reported
on. These articles were then imported to the Mendeley referencing tool
for sorting and analysis.
2.4. Bias
In preserving academic rigour and minimising bias, the following
biases were identified during the review, i.e., selection, reporting and
competing Bias. Selection bias, which can be interpreted as not selecting
all the relevant literature for the study (Hern´
an, Hernandez-Díaz, ´ &
Robins, 2004), was addressed by selecting four multidisciplinary database sources. According to (Drucker, Fleming, & Chan, 2016), reporting
bias equates to the selective reporting of findings; the researchers followed the steps set out in the PRISMA flow diagram, especially when it
came to the identification of the articles which were eligible for
reporting. Competing Bias may arise when research is funded and connected to a certain organisation (Drucker et al., 2016). To address this,
the researchers declare that there is no conflict of interest or association
with a particular organisation as this study is concerned.
2.5. Data analysis
Considering the qualitative nature of the study, a thematic analysis
of the data was conducted to provide a rich, descriptive representation
of the data gathered (Clarke, Braun, & Hayfield, 2015). This data
analysis approach allowed for a phased and structured data analysis.
According to (Peel, 2020), the first step in conducting thematic analysis
requires that the researchers familiarise themselves with the data. This
was achieved by sorting and categorising the data of the included articles. The initial codes were created through the observation of recurring
patterns, which resulted in themes which were created, and the findings
were then presented in a meaningful manner. The findings can be linked
back to the original research questions.
2.5.1. Coding strategy
Coding is an essential aspect of qualitative research, as it helps
analyze and interpret data extracted in relation to research questions.
Coding entails categorising concepts and identifying recurring patterns
and themes within the data through an iterative process (Creswell,
2015). In this review, a hybrid coding strategy combining both inductive
and deductive approaches was employed (Azungah, 2018). Inductive
coding involves deriving codes directly from the reviewed data, while
deductive coding utilises predefined codes from previous research. This
hybrid approach allowed for a flexible data analysis focusing on the
impact of AI on organisational cybersecurity. While some literature
already had predefined themes on this topic, enabling the deductive
establishment of themes, the rigorous evaluation of the literature led to
the emergence of additional themes and concepts, which required an
inductive coding approach.
3. Results
The outcome of the literature search and review resulted in a total of
73 articles remaining for detailed synthesis in line with the stated
research questions. Fig. 2 shows the breakdown of the synthesised articles, highlighting that most of the synthesised sources were 55 journal
articles and 18 conference papers, which is a good indication that peerreviewed sources were consulted to reach certain conclusions in this
study.
Fig. 3 depicts the distribution of the synthesised articles per year. In
terms of the distribution of the research articles based on the scope of
our study, which covers 2018–2023, it is evident that studies on the
impact of AI on organisational cybersecurity started gradually in 2019,
where only 1 study was found in relation to this study.
From 2020 to 2021, there was a gradual increase from 8 articles to 13
articles; in 2022, there was a sharp increase where the number of publications more than doubled to 28. In 2023, the number of relevant articles found was 23, which seems like a decline; however, considering
that at the time of writing of this article, a few months remained before
year-end, the number is more likely to increase. The picture portrayed in

Fig. 3 shows a growing interest by scholarly researchers in understanding the impact of AI on organisational cybersecurity, which could
be due to the ongoing advancements in the use of AI and relevant
techniques in Organisational cybersecurity.
The schematic depiction of the findings is in Fig. 4, and Tables 3–5
summarise the sub-themes identified in relation to research questions
one, two and three, respectively. The impact is centred around the
impact of AI on cybersecurity from an organisational perspective, which
is the main theme explained in relation to the stated research questions.
Fig. 4 presents a visual representation of the research findings. It
displays the results related to Q1, which are grouped together, and
separately showcases the findings for Q2 and Q3. Given that 73 articles
were analysed, this summary highlights some of the sub-themes
regarding the positive or negative influence of AI on Cybersecurity
from an organisational standpoint and how AI compares to the traditional approaches. Table 3 outlines the sub-themes derived from multiple sources as individual entries, while findings that were less common
but unique are consolidated under the “other” category.
AI’s most significant influence lies in the realm of vulnerability
management, especially in intrusion detection. It also plays a crucial role
in bolstering the security of organisational networks and systems against
cyber threats. The positive effects of AI on cybersecurity encompass
various facets, including predicting cyber incidents and aiding in data
recovery, ultimately contributing to an organisation’s competitive edge.
These overarching themes are presented in Table 3. These themes underscore certain trends in the prevalent applications of AI, including
intrusion detection, improved security measures, and the identification
of malicious software.
Table 4 provides an overview of the findings related to research
question 2, which examines the adverse effects of AI on cybersecurity
from an organisational standpoint. According to the results, most of the
identified negative consequences were categorised as unique and under
the “other” category. Additionally, the literature highlighted the

worrisome issue of AI systems being vulnerable to exploitation, which
poses a significant detriment to organisational cybersecurity.
A shortage of skilled individuals and the absence of effective AI
techniques for generating predictive explanations are perceived as factors that have a detrimental effect on organisations’ cybersecurity.
Additionally, adversarial attacks are recognised as contributors to
cybersecurity challenges, as hackers persistently endeavour to deploy
deceptive tactics that can outsmart security systems. Table 5 provides a
concise overview of AI’s performance compared to traditional non-AI
methods, and it pertains to the study’s third research question.
Based on the results of the experiments conducted in some of the
literature reviewed, comparing AI and non-AI approaches, it became
clear that AI-based methods outperformed the other methods in terms of
their effectiveness and precision, offering increased security and
improved capabilities for detecting intrusions.
3.1. Discussion
The literature review results are presented in this section to
comprehensively discuss the overall effects of AI-based solutions on
organisational cybersecurity. This analysis considers both the positive
and negative impacts. Furthermore, to gain a complete understanding of
the overall impact, a comparison between AI and traditional methods of
cyber protection was necessary for a broader view. Hence, this review
also examines the differences between AI and traditional, non-AI approaches to organisational cybersecurity.

3.1.1. The positive impact of AI on organisational cyber security
To evaluate the overall influence of AI on organisational cybersecurity, this review focuses on the question: “What is the positive impact
of AI on cybersecurity from an organisational perspective?” Existing
research indicates that the rise of cyber threats and attacks has
compelled organisations to adopt AI-based technologies for safeguarding their digital assets. While the initial driver for this adoption is
necessary to implement AI in organisational settings, and its application
to cyber protection results in significant competitive advantages to organisations (Dawson, 2021). Moreover, it is believed to bring a revolutionary change in modern-day cyber protection and its scope (Dawson,
2021). Table 3 presents a condensed overview of the underlying subtopics derived from the literature analysis related to the beneficial effects of utilizing AI in the context of malware detection (Al-Khshali &
Ilyas, 2023; Bhandari et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2022; Ullah et al., 2022),
as well as in identifying other network or system intrusion incidents (Ha
et al., 2022; Kaymakci et al., 2021; Krishnan et al., 2023). Additionally,
AI’s favourable influence extends to the realm of cybersecurity administration, streamlining operational procedures and enhancing overall
convenience (Angelopoulos et al., 2019; Ariffin & Maskat, 2021).
By considering humans as the weakest link in the security chain,
introducing AI-driven task automation is seen to address the vulnerabilities associated with human error in the workforce (Hansen & Bøgh,
2021). This is of utmost importance because, according to Alhayani et al.
(Alhayani et al., 2021), human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity breaches. Whether it is a decision-based mistake, a skill-related
oversight, or an error in task execution, intentional or not, eliminating
the potential for human error is the initial step in establishing a
well-protected cyber environment. This objective is achievable through
improved threat detection methods, where using unsupervised machine
learning intrusion detection systems (IDS) enables the identification of
even the smallest threats or attacks before they happen. In the past, this
task would take hours, but with AI, it can be done efficiently in seconds
(Zhang et al., 2021).
This automation extends to vulnerability management and decisionmaking, where a specific branch of AI, Neural networks and Natural
Language Processing (NLP), aids in the management and prioritisation
of both known and unknown threats. It achieves this by analysing
existing threats, newly discovered threats, false positives, network
behaviour baselines, systems, and servers (Zhan, 2021). Through the
identification of data patterns and the detection of abnormal behaviour,
the system can identify potential risks (De Azambuja et al., 2023).
Consequently, this automation enables organisations to adopt a proactive approach to recognising, anticipating, and addressing familiar and
unfamiliar threats (Aliyari, 2021) rather than relying solely on reactive
measures following a cyber breach. As stated by (Hariyanti, Djunaidy, &
Siahaan, 2021), the automation of cybersecurity tasks reduces the need
for human intervention, minimises human interaction, and subsequently
reduces the potential for human error throughout the entire security life
cycle.
In terms of organisational cybersecurity, it’s not just about advanced
software and protective solutions. The safeguarding of physical security
and vital hardware and infrastructure components is crucial for an
organisation to achieve comprehensive and mature cyber protection
(Aliyari, 2021). The multifaceted nature of artificial intelligence (AI) can
have a positive impact on the security of hardware and infrastructure by
optimising and monitoring data centres, servers, and processors
responsible for this protection (Angelopoulos et al., 2019). AI-powered
solutions employ machine learning techniques to monitor aspects such

as hardware temperature, cooling systems, power consumption, and
power backups. By analysing this data along with historical information,
these solutions enhance hardware performance and overall infrastructure efficiency. Moreover, AI implementation helps to minimise the
financial burden of hardware and infrastructure maintenance costs
necessary for protecting an organisation. It achieves this by intelligently
notifying organisations about scheduled maintenance or predicting potential failures of specific hardware components, enabling proactive
replacement before a complete breakdown occurs. Ultimately, integrating AI technologies with hardware and infrastructure maintenance
can provide financial savings for organisations and reduce the overall
power consumption of hardware components (Kaplan & Haenlein,
2019).
Another positive impact of the use of cyber-AI prominent in the
literature reviewed was the scalability and interconnectivity of AI solutions at a more advanced level (Ahamed et al., 2022). Network protection by means of AI-driven network analysis systems (NAS) and
network protection systems (NPS) can guarantee the safety and availability of computer networks within an organisation, not just for a single
computer but for an entire computer network system simultaneously
(Zhan, 2021). These AI solutions can be deployed at each stage of the
security life cycle, thus allowing for a more complete, well-rounded, and
interconnected solution (Raimundo & Ros´
ario, 2021).
3.1.2. The negative impact of AI on organisational cyber security
Although AI implementation in organisational cyber security is recognised for its ability to achieve efficiencies beyond human capabilities,
there are several drawbacks associated with its adoption, particularly at
the organisational level. Table 4 provides a condensed overview of the
limitations it encompasses. The increased adoption of AI has led to an
uptick in adversarial attacks, raising the threat of cyberattacks. The
existence or absence of relevant regulations and standards can impede
AI adoption within an organisation. These negative effects hinder or
defer the widespread acceptance of AI solutions as a mainstream
cybersecurity approach.
According to current literature, one of the main obstacles to the
widespread adoption of AI in the cyber realm is its impact on infrastructure and hardware requirements. To effectively implement AIdriven solutions at the organisational level, significant computational
power, processing capabilities, and memory are necessary (Dawson,
2021). Furthermore, larger and more advanced AI models demand
modern central processing units (CPUs) that can perform ten times faster
than traditional processors, resulting in substantial implementation
costs (Wilkins, 2018). Another challenge lies in the compatibility issues
caused by the continued use of outdated systems, programming languages, and overall technological infrastructure in many organisations.
These legacy systems fail to adequately support the requirements of AI
and machine learning (ML) techniques. For instance, the analysis of vast
amounts of complex data, a critical step in successful AI and ML
deployment, is hindered by the lack of scalability offered by legacy
databases and obsolete systems. In essence, implementing AI solutions
in organisations is not a simple task, as it often necessitates a complete
overhaul of the technological infrastructure (Arasada, 2021).
The literature consistently highlights a recurring theme of insufficient availability of high-quality, error-free & cleaned data. AI solutions
rely on extensive datasets for training models and achieving accurate
results. As a result, obtaining a large quantity of data is essential for
training AI models effectively (Sun & Bai, 2022). Moreover, implementing a cyber-AI solution necessitates a more complex organisational
data management process due to the diverse volumes and types of data
stored, the speed at which data is accumulated, the need to maintain
data confidentiality, and the constant requirement for additional data
(Raimundo & Rosario, ´ 2021). This aspect is particularly crucial because
the intelligence of AI solutions relies solely on the quality of the datasets
used to train the models.
There is no universal cyber-AI solution that fits all situations, as most
AI systems need to be customized for specific organisations in some way
(Cucu et al., 2019). Although some solutions can be put into practice
relatively quickly, it has been observed that the time required to
implement most Cyber-AI solutions at an organisational level negatively
affects their adoption. This delay can be attributed to the inherent
complexity of modern AI itself, and even the simplest AI solution may
take months or even years to fully implement within an organisation
(Attaran & Deb, 2018). This extended implementation period is mainly
due to hardware restructuring, acquiring the necessary data for training
and testing the models, and allowing sufficient time for the models to
comprehend and learn the unique networking and behavioural patterns
specific to the organisation (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019).
Besides the long implementation time, it was discovered that
implementing Cyber-AI presents a challenge due to its multidisciplinary
nature, requiring a range of specialised professionals such as data scientists, data analysts, AI experts, machine learning specialists, developers, cybersecurity specialists, and project managers, each with
different levels of technical expertise (Attaran & Deb, 2018).Arasada
(Arasada, 2021) also notes that this extensive requirement for skilled
personnel poses a difficulty for organisations, given the current shortage
of qualified and experienced professionals in these specialised fields who
can effectively implement and manage cyber-AI solutions at an organisational level. Moreover, organisations often face significant financial
burdens in recruiting these scarce professionals (Attaran & Deb, 2018;
Dawson, 2021; Lim, 2022). On the other hand, the introduction of
cyber-AI solutions brings automation to the organisation, which
threatens many cyber-related jobs due to its ability to offer faster, more
accurate, and reliable cybersecurity solutions (Lim, 2022). Although it is
unlikely that AI will completely replace the need for human employees,
(Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019) explains that its introduction to the cybersecurity domain alone poses a threat to certain roles, jobs, and tasks
related to cybersecurity, as they may become obsolete with the implementation of cyber-AI solutions.
Exploiting AI systems gives hackers the autonomy to utilise AI-based
attacks that can evade AI-based protective measures (AL-Dosari et al.,
2022; Tetaly & Kulkarni, 2022), potentially resulting in privacy
breaches. These AI-driven attacks have the capability to evolve faster
than the protective tools themselves, thanks to a technique called neural
fuzzing. Neural fuzzing employs neural networks to identify vulnerabilities in target systems, allowing attackers to learn from existing AI
protective tools (Agrawal et al., 2023; Zhan, 2021). The unreliability of
generative AI is also a concern in some organisations due to the high
number of false positives.
3.1.3. How does the use of AI differ from traditional, non-AI-driven means
of organisational cyber security?
To fully gauge the impact of AI on organisational cyber security, it
was determined that a comparison needed to be made between traditional cyber security approaches and AI-driven approaches. Whilst there
is limited literature that directly explores the difference between AI and
traditional, non-AI driven means of cyber protection, it was found that in
addition, a traditional reactive approach to cyber security, where the
aim is to wait for an attack and then neutralise it, AI enables a proactive
approach to not only reacting but anticipating and dealing with a breach
(Raimundo & Rosario, ´ 2021). This is made possible through AI-driven
threat intelligence and prediction that can learn from past experiences
and data available to recognise anomalous behaviours (Zhan, 2021). AI
methods have demonstrated superior performance in contrast to alternative methods, as evidenced by several studies (Diallo & Patras, 2021;
Haider et al., 2020; Massaro et al., 2020). In the conducted experiments,
AI solutions have consistently outperformed other approaches in intrusion detection (Keshk et al., 2023; Selçuk, 2019) due to their enhanced
precision (Mogollon-Guti ´ ´errez et al., 2023; The et al., 2023) and
heightened security capabilities (Agrawal et al., 2023; Jadav et al.,
2023).
However, compared to traditional approaches, the interrelated
I. Jada and T.O. Mayayise 
Data and Information Management xxx (xxxx) xxx
8
nature of AI with other protective components is seen to bring about
additional, non-traditional vulnerabilities in the security chain (Angelopoulos et al., 2019). According to Mohammed (Mohammed, 2020), if
any interrelated component of an AI system is compromised, it is likely
that the entire system will be compromised. For example, if the training
data sets used to train the models are compromised, it may affect the
outcome of the ‘learning results’, and thus, the entire model may not
perform as intended. Therefore, although AI provides greater protection,
AI systems require increased protection throughout the security development lifecycle as opposed to traditional approaches (Hariyanti et al.,
2021).
Additionally, it was found that the difference between these two
approaches also stems from the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all solution like traditional firewalls, anti-virus software or antimalware
software (Cucu et al., 2019). Each AI solution must be tailored to a
specific organisation using organisational-specific internal and external
data (Raimundo & Ros´
ario, 2021). This requires not only a greater
financial and manpower commitment but also a greater hardware and
infrastructure commitment to implement compared to traditional approaches. It was evident that whilst traditional network security tools
such as firewalls and anti-virus software are universal, they are seen
today as border-based protection (Zhan, 2021). AI-driven network
analysis systems (NAS) have substituted these traditional network protection mechanisms as it is simply much faster and more efficient
compared to the traditional approaches (Aliyari, 2021).
Lastly, the implementation of AI solutions at an organisational level
is subject to stricter laws and regulations as compared to traditional
cyber security approaches. Whilst AI is mainly used for defensive purposes in organisational cyber security, certain governments and regulatory bodies have regulated high-risk AI applications to ensure the
responsible use of such a powerful technology (Rawindaran et al.,
2021).
3.2. Limitations of the study
This study provides valuable insights into AI’s impact on organisational cybersecurity, but it has limitations. It takes a broad view of
Cyber-AI’s influence on organisations, overlooking variations among
organisation types, sizes, sectors, and regions, which can yield different
effects. It doesn’t delve into specific AI tools, limiting our understanding
of their diverse impacts. Time constraints restricted the literature search
to four databases, potentially excluding relevant materials from other
sources. Additionally, the inclusion/exclusion criteria narrowed down
the selection of pertinent literature, focusing on English publications
between 2018 and 2023.
3.3. Recommendations for future research
This study concentrated on examining how AI influences organisational cybersecurity. Future research endeavours may direct attention
toward investigating the specific impact of AI on distinct types of institutions, such as those in financial, manufacturing, healthcare,
educational, critical infrastructure, and government sectors. A more
targeted exploration of these areas could yield deeper insights, aiding in
the optimal utilisation of AI for enhanced cybersecurity. Additionally, it
would facilitate the development of measures to mitigate potential
malicious exploits where AI tools are employed with harmful intentions,
specifically targeting certain institutions. Comparative analyses could
also be conducted to evaluate the effects of AI usage on cybersecurity
within organisational types in specific countries. Furthermore, forthcoming studies might dissect the impact of AI on cybersecurity, examining its repercussions on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of information within organisations.
It’s worth noting that most of the existing literature in this field has
concentrated on large, well-established organisations, so there is a need
for more attention on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Furthermore, the impacts of AI on cybersecurity identified in this review
are broad and not specific to any AI-powered cybersecurity solution.
Therefore, future research could explore the effects of specific AI solutions and tools on an organisation’s cybersecurity.
Cucu (Cucu et al., 2019) reports a significant rise in sophisticated
cyber-attacks, prompting the adoption of AI algorithms for detecting
unusual behaviour and analysing extensive data sets. This shift poses a
challenge to static, non-AI approaches, urging the adaptation of existing
technologies to address evolving threats. Prospective research ought to
examine the effectiveness of AI-driven and unconventional AI approaches in cybersecurity. It is crucial to explore how non-AI methods
can be adjusted to address upcoming cybersecurity threats. Additionally, emphasis should be placed on incorporating the human factor, as
certain attacks may still occur due to human error or insufficient
awareness of specific threats (AL-Hawamleh, 2023).
When artificial intelligence is employed to compromise organizational cybersecurity, it can lead to significant financial losses. Further
research could explore the financial implications of AI on organisational
cybersecurity, particularly focusing on the impact of cyber-attacks that
result in data losses. This investigation would aim to determine the recovery period and the associated costs involved in recovering from such
security breaches.
Given the absence of standardized regulations for AI utilisation
across countries, prospective research can delve into diverse legal
frameworks that effectively oversee the application of AI in cybersecurity within different nations. These studies have the potential to
mitigate the risk of malicious AI usage in organisations by contributing
to the establishment of more comprehensive and effective regulatory
measures.
One prevalent issue associated with machine learning models is their
dependence on precise datasets for making accurate predictions.
Consequently, there is a need for research to develop improved approaches for identifying errors in datasets (Wazid et al., 2022).
The existing literature highlights a growing interest in employing
artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity, sparking ongoing discussions about the efficacy of AI methods in fortifying cybersecurity across
various domains. Particularly, research emphasis has been placed on
utilizing AI for intrusion detection (Maia et al., 2022; Redino et al.,
2022; Sivamohan & Sridhar, 2023; Sowmya & Mary Anita, 2023; Sowmya and Mary Anita, 2023, 2023), as well as for enhancing protection
and identifying malware (Al-Khshali & Ilyas, 2023; Kumar et al., 2022;
Ullah et al., 2022). Earlier studies also delved into the potential
exploitation of AI systems and their utilisation in launching adversarial
attacks (AL-Dosari et al., 2022; Fritsch et al., 2022; Tetaly & Kulkarni,
2022; Truong et al., 2020). Given the dual nature of AI—capable of
being used for both positive and malicious purposes—there is a need to
scrutinise governance issues concerning the use of AI for cybersecurity
within organisations. Future research endeavours should delve into
these governance aspects and their implications.
4. Conclusion
As technology adoption within organisations grows, the occurrence
of cyber threats and attacks also rises. Existing literature indicates a
pressing requirement for enhanced and secure methods of organisational cyber security using AI-driven solutions to safeguard against
constantly evolving threats. Hence, the objective of this research was to
assess the overall influence of AI-driven solutions on organisational
cyber security. This study examined the advantages and disadvantages
of implementing AI-based cyber solutions in organisations and
compared their effectiveness to conventional cyber security approaches.
Through this literature review, it was discovered that the utilisation
of AI-powered solutions affects the cyber security of organisations
throughout the entire security life cycle. On the positive side, AI contributes to organisational cyber security by automating processes, analysing, and predicting threats, improving hardware and infrastructure

security, managing vulnerabilities, aiding decision-making, and overall
enhancing the robustness and resilience of system security. Conversely,
there are negative implications of AI on organisational cyber security.
These include significant data requirements, the need for skilled professionals, hardware and infrastructure demands, challenges in implementation, and the potential threat it poses to cybersecurity-related job
positions. Additionally, since hackers themselves utilise AI for attacks,
certain attacks have become resistant to AI-based protective measures.
While AI enables a proactive approach to cyber security, it also introduces additional vulnerabilities that need to be considered before
implementing it at an organisational level. Factors such as the absence of
universal AI-based solutions and the need for stricter regulations
compared to traditional cybersecurity approaches should be considered.
In summary, despite some disadvantages, incorporating AI solutions
into organisational cybersecurity has a predominantly beneficial effect.
Essentially, AI usage offers an effective, advanced, and heightened level
of cyber protection. This outcome theoretically establishes a foundation
for future studies, which can delve into specific factors like
organisational size and type and assess the impact of AI. From a practical
standpoint, these findings can assist organisations in making betterinformed choices regarding AI solutions by providing an unbiased
evaluation of the associated impacts.
