Literature Review: The South African Software Industry as a Key Component of Economic Development:
Pipedream or Possibility?
Introduction:
The Information and Communication sector has experienced significant growth and transformation in
recent years, leading to numerous studies investigating its impact on economic growth and development.
This literature review aims to explore the role of the South African software industry in contributing to
economic development. Despite historical obstacles, South Africa has emerged as an influential economic
force in Africa, and understanding the potential of the software industry in this context is of great
importance.
Role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Economic Growth:
Numerous studies have highlighted the significant impact of information and communication technologies
on economic growth and development. These technologies have been shown to contribute to increased
productivity, innovation, and efficiency in various sectors (Aker, 2011). The South African software
industry, as a subset of the ICT sector, has the potential to play a crucial role in driving economic
development in the country.
Emerging Economic Force in Africa:
South Africa's current economic status and its role in Africa position it as an emerging economic force
in the continent. The country's economy has shown resilience and growth, despite historical challenges.
It serves as an example for other African countries in terms of economic development (Mukala, 2009).
However, the potential of the software industry as a key component of this development needs further
examination.
Importance of the Software Industry in Economic Development:
The software industry has been recognized as a key driver of economic development in various contexts.
It contributes to job creation, export earnings, and technological advancements (Aker, 2011). In the
South African context, the software industry has the potential to leverage its strengths and contribute
significantly to economic growth.
Challenges and Obstacles:
While South Africa has exhibited economic growth, there are still challenges and obstacles that need to be
addressed for the software industry to reach its full potential. These challenges include limited access to

technology, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled professionals (Mukala, 2009). Addressing
these challenges is crucial for the software industry to become a key component of economic development.
Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions:
Despite the existing literature on the role of the software industry in economic development, there are
several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. These gaps include:
1. The specific factors that contribute to the success of the software industry in South Africa.
2. The impact of government policies and initiatives on the growth and development of the software
industry.
3. The potential of collaboration and partnerships between the software industry and other sectors in
driving economic development.
4. The role of entrepreneurship and innovation in the growth of the software industry.
Future research should aim to address these knowledge gaps to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the potential of the South African software industry as a key component of economic development.
Conclusion:
The South African software industry has the potential to play a crucial role in economic development. As
an emerging economic force in Africa, South Africa can leverage the strengths of its software industry to
drive innovation, job creation, and export earnings. However, addressing challenges such as limited access
to technology and skilled professionals is essential. Future research should focus on filling knowledge
gaps and exploring the specific factors that contribute to the success of the software industry in South
Africa. By doing so, the South African software industry can become a reality rather than just a pipedream
in driving economic development.
