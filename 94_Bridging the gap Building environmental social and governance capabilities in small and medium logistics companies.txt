ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the popularity of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance measurement has
dramatically increased, particularly to listed companies, for supporting various investment decisions. Companies
with high ESG scores imply that their ongoing business development is recognised to be economically, socially,
and environmentally sustainable. From the current ESG measurement practice, the measurement frameworks are
built on rating schemes, such as KLD and ASSET4, so as to derive the ESG scores for listed companies. However,
such existing measurement frameworks are difficult to be implemented in small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
with unstructured and non-standardised business data, especially in logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) practice. In addition, it is inevitable for listed companies to work with SMEs, for example logistics service
providers, but they need a systematic framework to source the responsible SMEs to maintain the ESG performance. To address the above industrial pain-points, this study proposes an ESG development prioritisation and
performance measurement framework (ESG-DPPMF) by means of the Bayesian best-worst method enabling the
group decision-making capability to prioritise the ESG development areas and formulate the performance
measurement scheme. Through consolidating the opinions from logistics practitioners, it is found that fair labour
practice, reverse logistics and human right in supply chains are the most essential areas to further enhance ESG
capabilities in the logistics industry. In addition, the viability of the ESG performance measurement has been
validated, and thus the sustainable and human-centric logistics practice can be developed to achieve business
sustainability.
1. Introduction
In recent years, a series of global supply chain disruptions, including
the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian war, have caused
significant disruptions to the global economy, leading to highly fluctuated and sensitive stock markets worldwide. In addition to financial
performance, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance
are increasingly being considered by investors and fund companies as
part of a sustainable financing strategy (Friede et al., 2015; Klier, 2020).
This means that companies in which investors are investing are not only
expected to be profitable but also sustainable and socially responsible.
According to a market survey by the Royal Bank of Canada (2021), it is
worth noting that more investors believe that investing in companies
with good ESG performance can reduce investment risks and increase
investment returns. In 2018, one of Xiaomi’s suppliers illegally
discharged sewage, breaching environmental protection regulations
(Liao, 2018), which affected Xiaomi’s listing plan on the Hong Kong
stock exchange market. This illustrates that a company’s profitability
does not guarantee its long-term business sustainability, which can be
influenced by environmental and social scandals. Therefore, ESG aspects
are increasingly being considered in business decisions. Listed companies are now eager to develop their own ESG capabilities by following
well-known ESG measurement frameworks to continuously build a
sustainable commercial image in the market (Calabrese et al., 2021).
Regarding the development of ESG capabilities, there are abundant
resources and talent available from listed companies to structure and
standardize the business data and operations related to ESG performance measurement criteria (Naffa and Fain, 2020). For general business operations, listed companies need to build a contractual
relationship with logistics service providers (LSPs) to facilitate freight

operations, warehousing, and transportation management. However,
some of the LSPs are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with limited
capital and human resources to fully comply with the state-of-the-art
ESG measurement criteria. For instance, in most SMEs, data related to
carbon and greenhouse gas emissions are not organized in a structured
format. According to the Trade and Industry Department of Hong Kong,
over 340,000 SMEs are operating in various business sectors, constituting 98% of the business establishments and employing 45% of the
total workforce in the private sector (Trade and Industry Department,
2022). SMEs in the trading and logistics sectors account for one-third of
all business establishments in Hong Kong (Support and Consultation
Centre for SMEs, 2021). In view of that, listed companies cannot avoid
working with LSCM-related SMEs in the market, but it is difficult to
determine if they satisfy ESG requirements or not using the existing
measurement frameworks. Therefore, a research gap for enhancing the
SMEs’ ESG capabilities for LSCM is spotted with the two research
questions (RQs) in this study. There is an urgent need to prioritise the
ESG development areas of the SMEs due to the limited resources and
talents, while a systematic ESG performance measurement should be
established in an objective and mutually agreed-upon manner.
RQ1. What are prioritised areas to develop ESG capabilities for SMEs in the
logistics industry?
RQ2. How can the ESG performance measurement be measured for SMEs
in the logistics industry?
In view of the above research questions, this study proposes an ESG
development prioritisation and performance measurement framework
(ESG-DPPMF) for LSCM-related SMEs, in which the of the Bayesian bestworst method (BWM) is applied to analyse the expert opinions in the
form of pairwise comparisons in a group decision-making process.
Subsequently, the expert opinions can be systematically aggregated to
prioritise the ESG development areas and to formulate the ESG performance measurement scheme. Consequently, the SMEs can effectively
understand their own weaknesses for further improvements, while listed
companies are convenient to spot the green LSPs to satisfy their own ESG
implementation policies. Beyond the business perspectives, the advocacy of ESG concepts in the logistics industry can facilitate sustainable
development and social responsibility in the business environment,
aligning with the initiatives of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
sustainable development goals (SDGs).
The contribution of this study can be summarised in two-facets.
Firstly, the viability of the proposed framework has been validated in
a case study with several logistics practitioners and SMEs to prioritise
the ESG development areas and performance measurement. Secondly, as
a highly urbanised city in the case study, it is found that the ESG
development in logistics industry should focus more on the aspects of
fair labour practice, reverse logistics and human right in supply chains.
2. Literature review
In this section, the concepts and foundation of ESG are firstly discussed to outline its definitions, value, and differences from existing
initiatives, including CSR and SDGs. Furthermore, in order to develop a
customised ESG performance measurement framework for SMEs in the
logistics industry, the existing measurement approaches are secondly
benchmarked for the research investigation.
2.1. Overview of ESG principles
ESG is a conception to further revamp the contemporary business
environment with enhanced sustainability, initiated in 2004 by the
United Nations (Billio et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Hamzah et al., 2023).
Furthermore, responsible, sustainable, and green investments are
advocated along with ESG development. As a result, investors consider
ESG as a yardstick for assessing corporate behaviour and future financial
performance. As an investment concept for evaluating enterprises’
sustainable development, ESG contains three essential elements that
need to be examined in the process of investment analysis and
decision-making. Some investors believe that environmental, social, and
governance standards have practical values that transcend ethical issues
in recent years (GillanKoch and Starks, 2021). By adhering to ESG
standards, investors may avoid companies whose practices may be a
harbinger of risk factors, as evidenced by Volkswagen’s emissions
scandal in 2010, which influenced the company’s stock price and led to
billions of dollars in capital losses. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the
global economic fluctuation raises the value of ESG to effectively identify reliable and sustainable companies from the stock market, where
more and more corporate ESG strategies are implemented to achieve
business success (Duque-Grisales and Aguilera-Caracuel, 2019; Ferriani
and Natoli, 2021; Khan et al., 2022). Overall, because of the scrutiny of
the environment and the impact of the new crown epidemic, ESG has
become increasingly valuable for investors and has even become an
additional reference for investors to avoid investment risks.
Furthermore, when mentioning ESG, CSR and SDGs are also two
similar initiatives that focus on social responsibility and sustainable
development, respectively. On one hand, CSR tends to conceptually
develop responsible companies for environmental and social aspects,
while ESG is applied to quantify the corresponding concepts into the
measurement indicators (GillanKoch and Starks, 2021). On the other
hand, ESG is regarded as the enabler to promote SDGs in the industries,
in which companies are eager to build their own ESG capabilities to get
more attention from investors (De Franco et al., 2021). Apart from the
generalised ESG frameworks, a tailor-made ESG framework is of utmost
importance to achieve the sustainability goals and objectives in the industries. From the environmental aspect, the overuse, misuse, and
destruction of natural resources in the supply chain operations should be
eliminated, for example, fuel, packaging materials, and yield loss. From
the social aspect, human-centricity is emphasized to assess the impacts
of organisations and supply chains, and thus a people-oriented atmosphere can be established. From the perspective of governance, ethical
and resilient policies for supply chain governance should be developed
to fully comply with business ethical standards and codes of conduct.
2.2. Existing ESG-related measurement protocols
Regarding the practical value of ESG, ESG performance measurement is widely explored in the contemporary business sector, as the basis
for examining the effectiveness of corporate ESG practices and the
standard for corporate ESG disclosure.
In this section, two major ESG measurement databases are reviewed,
namely KLD and ASSET4, which establish the ESG scoring mechanism
for companies so as to identify industry leaders and laggards (Velte,
2017; Eccles et al., 2020). On one hand, KLD contains extensive CSR
ratings, including seven key stakeholder attributes: (i) community; (ii)
employee relations; (iii) diversity, (iv) environment; (v) human rights;
(vi) product sustainability; and, (vii) corporate governance. On the other
hand, ASSET4 is another widely used database that has consistently
provided comprehensive CSR data for companies in the Russell 1000
Index. After collecting the annual ESG data, analysts conduct a unified
quantitative analysis of the qualitative data. In terms of measurement,
studies measuring ESG typically choose an annual environmental score,
social score, and governance score to construct a CSR index by equally
weighting each pillar of the three dimensions. The two ESG measurement methods mentioned above evaluate CSR to derive ESG indices.
However, the focus and content of ESG and CSR are slightly different.
The content of ESG is more specific than CSR, and ESG focuses more on
the joint evaluation of the three factors of environment, society, and
governance to obtain the ESG index. Therefore, this paper hopes to
develop a more specific ESG scoring framework for SMEs based on the
original ESG measurement methods so that SMEs and other stakeholders, such as their service vendors and business partners, can also
benefit from it to comprehensively understand their ESG performance.

In general, commonly used ESG data has two characteristics: First,
since ESG research is an emerging topic, the data are mainly from the
KLD and ASSET4 databases. Second, although existing research institutions have formed ESG measurement and evaluation systems, they
still have limitations in diversity and breadth. In the current study, while
the ASSET4 database and the KLD database are still mainstream, ESG
should embed different institutional contexts and industry characteristics to address global sustainability issues more comprehensively. The
effectiveness and reliability of the KLD and ASSET4 databases in ESG
measurements for specific SMEs remain questionable (Esposito De Falco
et al., 2021). Listed companies must work with sustainable companies to
achieve higher ESG scores, but it is difficult to know whether the SMEs
they work with are green.
2.3. Summary of the literature review
From the extant literature, the research gap in enhancing the ESG
capabilities of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the logistics
industry is determined, which is essential for listed companies as they
rely on SMEs for their logistics operations. There is an urgent need to
evaluate the importance of ESG in assessing corporate behaviour and
future financial performance, and how investors consider ESG as a
yardstick for evaluating enterprises’ sustainable development. Additionally, the customisation of ESG development prioritisation and performance measurement for the logistics industry is required as an
enabler to promote sustainable development goals (SDGs).
3. Research methodology
In this section, the research methodology for customising the ESG
performance measurement framework for SMEs in the logistics industry
is proposed. Consequently, their ESG performance can be effectively
quantified to facilitate internal benchmarking so as to spot industry
leaders and laggards.
3.2. Overview of the methodological framework
The research methodology for the LSCM-related ESG performance
measurement is presented as in Fig. 1. In the first phase, literature reviews, surveys, and expert interview are conducted to determine which
LSCM-related metrics should be used as measurement criteria. In order
to establish practical and achievable measurement items, several wellknown standards and protocols adopted by SMEs in the logistics industry are considered, including ISO9001, ISO14001, Transported Asset
Protection Association (TAPA), Customs Trade Partnership Against
Terrorism (C-TPAT), Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), and CSR.
Accordingly, the appropriate criteria are selected to enrich the ESG
framework on top of Langley’s ESG criteria as shown in Table 1, where
the level-2 criteria can thus be derived. The measurement criteria were
then integrated into a rating checklist to assist the ESG assessment for
SMEs. In the second phase, the criteria weightings are determined
through pairwise comparisons by domain experts. It is assumed that the
criteria weightings in the logistics industry are not equally identical. In
other words, domain experts in the logistics industry may have their
own perspective regarding the recent focus from the ESG perspectives.
To systematically determine the criteria weightings, the group multicriteria decision-making approach, namely Bayesian BWM, is applied.
A group of qualified experts in the logistics industry are invited to
participate in these pairwise comparisons. In the third stage, after
obtaining the pairwise comparison data from a group of domain experts,
the importance of ESG development areas can be prioritised, while the
ESG performance measurement scheme can be formulated to evaluate
the industrial practitioners. Therefore, the resultant ESG scores of SMEs
are comparable among the peer companies, while all the ESG scores can
be visualised for further analysis.

3.3. Tier 1: ESG performance measurement criteria for SMEs in LSCM
According to Langley’s ESG framework for supply chain focused
areas (Langley, 2021), the proposed framework is further extended by
considering the accreditations from ISO 9001, ISO 14001, Transported
Asset Protection Association (TAPA), Customs Trade Partnership
Against Terrorism (CTPAT) as well as the protocols of environment,
health and safety (EHS) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the
context of LSCM. Therefore, practical criteria and sub-criteria can be
suggested to facilitate the real-life ESG assessment in the logistics industry, as shown in Table 1.
The ESG framework designed in the study has three hierarchical
levels. Level-0 the ESG goals, level-1 is the three essential ESG elements,
and level-2 is the sub-criteria of environmental, social and governance.
The third level is the sub-criteria of the second level of criteria, namely
the evaluation metrics, based on the above standards and protocols
related to real-life LSCM. Based on the defined criteria and sub-criteria,
the rating checklist can be formulated to assist the ESG performance
measurement for LSCM-related SMEs, and thus their ESG performance
can be quantified in a practical manner, as shown in Tables 2–4 for
environmental, social and governance aspects, respectively. Based on
the above ESG rating scheme, the targeted SMEs are assessed by qualified experts to obtain the scores of level-3 sub-criteria, where the subcriteria are evaluated as the binary items. In other words, the SMEs
can be systematically assessed in terms of environmental, social, and
governance aspects with three rating vectors, namely [rE
1,…,rE
7], [rS
1,…,
rS
6], and [rG
1 , …, rG
6 ]. The ratings for various aspects are calculated as
expressed in Equation (1), where i ∈ I denotes the level-1 criteria,
including E, S, and G; j ∈ J denotes the number of level-2 criteria, and
k ∈ K denotes the number of level-3 sub-criteria. Since the number of
binary items at level-3 sub-criteria are inconsistent, the min-max normalisation is performed to generalise the ratings into the range [1, 10],
as expressed in Equation (2).

3.4. Tier 2: criteria weighting by using bayesian best worst method
Apart from the above ESG rating checklist, the weightings of criteria
at levels 1 and 2 are determined in this tier to achieve market-driven ESG
performance measurement. The best-worst method (BWM) is a vectorbased approach proposed by J. Rezaei in 2015 that derives weights
based on pairwise comparisons of the best and worst criteria for solving
multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem (Rezaei, 2015).
Compared to another method, namely the analytical hierarchy process
(AHP), BWM has advantages in the number of pairwise comparisons to
be conducted and result consistency. To further apply the BWM in the
group-based decision-making process, Bayesian BWM was proposed,
where probabilistic modelling was used to calculate the aggregated
distribution and all individual preferences at once (Mohammadi and
Rezaei, 2020).
To determine the criteria weightings at levels 1 and 2, a group of
domain experts in the context of LSCM are invited to complete the
pairwise comparisons, while the Bayesian BWM is applied to calculate
the resultant weightings. At the beginning, each domain expert has to
select the best and worst criteria at levels 1 and 2, while the pairwise
comparisons in the Bayesian BWM are merely designed for comparing

best-to-others and others-to-worst. In order to aggregate the opinions
from various domain experts, the group decision-making process is
modelled by using a Bayesian model where a joint probability distribution is built to estimate the aggregated weight w∗∈ {φi
, ωi
} and the
optimal criterion weights of m decision makers w1:m based on the
collected pairwise comparison data of best-to-others C1:m
b− o and others-toworst C1:m
o− w vectors. The joint probability distribution is mathematically
expressed as the conditional probability as in Equation (3). In the
mathematical model, the vectors related to the collected pairwise
comparison data are the observed variables, namely the inputs, which
are analysed to estimate the optimal weights w∗ is dependent on the
optimal weights w1:m. By applying the Bayes theorem, the joint probability distribution in Equation (3) can then be simplified into the hierarchical structure, as in Equation (4).

Furthermore, the vector components Ci
o− w and Ci
b− o are modelled by
the multinomial distribution such that Ci

⃒wi ∼ multinomial(wi

Ci
b− o

⃒
⃒wi ∼ multinomial(

, where ∀i ∈ 1,…, k. In addition, the Dirichlet
distribution is reparametrized to model wi with respect to the mean of
the distribution w∗ and a concentration parameter γ, such that
wi
|w∗ ∼ Dir(γ • w∗), where the parameter γ is modelled in a gamma
distribution. Consequently, for computing the posterior distribution, a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo technique, namely Just Another Gibbs
Sampler (JAGS), is applied, and thus the posterior distribution of
weights for decision makers and the aggregated weight can be obtained.
In addition, credal ranking as a ranking scheme for the decision criteria
can be constructed to investigate the confidence levels between various
criteria. It shows the interrelations of the criteria so as to determine the
superiority of product features in the product innovation process. Based
on the aggregated weight and credal ranking, the importance of the
level-1 and level-2 criteria can be prioritised to derive the focal areas for
contemporary ESG development. In addition, the ESG performance
measurement can be established through utilising the optimal weights.
In other words, two vectors are obtained as the input for the Bayesian
BWM so as to perform the group decision-making process for the
determination of criteria weightings, namely [φE, φS, φG] for level-1
criteria and [ωE
1,…,ωE
7], [ωS
1,…,ωS
6] and [ωG
1 , …,ωG
6 ] for level-2 criteria,
where φi
, ωi ∈ [0,1].
3.5. Tier 3: ESG prioritisation and performance aggregation
Based on the credal ranking from the Bayesian BWM, the prioritisation of the ESG criteria can be derived in which the optimal criterion
weights are used to evaluate the confidence τ ∈ [0, 1] between criteria.
Since the company ratings and criteria weightings have been determined in the above two tiers, the aggregation to obtain the ESG performance scores is performed, as expressed in Equations (5)–(7)
separately, where the value ̂ri
j represents the normalised ratings by
means of min-max normalisation as expressed in Equation (2).
Furthermore, the aggregated ESG performance scores are expressed in
Equation (8) for overall assessment. As a result, the resultant ESG performance scores for SMEs are ranged between 1 and 10 for effective
comparison, given that ∑

Considered that a group of SMEs, namely C = {1,…,c}, are assessed
by the above mechanism, a 4 × c matrix for ESG performance scores is
established as expressed in Equation (9). Beyond quantifying the ESG
performance of the SMEs, a benchmarking mechanism between the
SMEs is also embedded to identify the market leaders and laggards.
Therefore, the average values of the E, S and G performance scores,
namely [θE, θS, θG] are used to classify the SMEs in the eight regions as
shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the eight regions with comparisons to the
threshold are illustrated, where regions V and III are regarded as the
market leaders and laggards, respectively.

4. Case study
In order to investigate the viability and performance of the proposed
framework, a case study in the Hong Kong logistics industry is conducted, where 10 SMEs and 5 domain experts are invited for the
investigation about the ESG development. The SMEs with logistics
practice can thus be evaluated using the proposed framework, and
compared with their peer competitors for continuous improvement in a
healthy competitive environment.
4.1. Background of the case study
From the industrial perspective, the concepts of ESG have been
widely discussed among industrialists, in particular with large-scale
enterprises and listed companies. Most of them are eager to be
assessed by well-known and credible ESG consultants so as to publicise a
responsible reputation in the market. In the contemporary business
environment, most enterprises, even listed companies, are inevitable to
have business collaborations with SMEs for customised services and
solutions, for example, logistics services. In order to maintain their ESG
performance, most enterprises tend to collaborate with the service
vendors that follow the ESG requirements and criteria, but it is difficult
for SMEs to conduct a formal ESG measurement due to a lack of resources and talents. Consequently, large-scale and listed companies are
required to assess the vendors by themselves, which is time-consuming
and lacks a standard assessment protocol. Furthermore, SMEs themselves are challenged to develop their own ESG capabilities, not to
mention the regular ESG assessment. In view of that, 5 domain experts
and 10 SMEs are included in this case study to examine focal areas of the
ESG development in the logistics industry, in which the demographic
details of the domain experts and SMEs are shown in Tables 2 and 3 For
the selection of domain experts, the relevant experience and current
positions are considered, where the top management in the logistics
companies is preferable to determine the criteria weights.
4.2. Determination of ESG rating and criteria weightings
In order to measure the SMEs’ ESG performance, a qualified assessor
under the proposed framework is assigned to conduct on-site visits for
all the SMEs listed in Table 2, while the SMEs are required to elaborate
and provide evidence related to the criteria and sub-criteria. Thus, the
ESG ratings for all ten SMEs can be collected in this study, in which the
scores of level-3 criteria are summed together to show the performance
by level-2 categories. With the min-max normalisation, the normalised
ESG ratings, as shown in Table 4, for SME are then ready for aggregation
after the ESG criteria weightings are determined by domain experts.
Subsequently, the pairwise comparisons for the level-1 and level-2
criteria are conducted by the invited domain experts. Regarding the
level-1 criteria, Table 5 shows the data from the pairwise comparisons
from the domain experts. By using the Bayesian BWM, it is found that the
criteria weights between three criteria are: [0.3350, 0.3482, 0.3168].
Regarding the level-2 criteria under the environmental aspect,
Table 6 shows the data of the pairwise comparisons, and the criteria
weightings among the seven criteria are: [0.1369, 0.2159, 0.1539,
0.1352, 0.1071, 0.1299, 0.1210].
Regarding the level-2 criteria under the social aspect, Table 7 shows
the data of the pairwise comparisons, and the criteria weightings among
the six criteria are: [0.1191, 0.2468, 0.1469, 0.1898, 0.1474, 0.1501].
Regarding the level-2 criteria under the governance aspect, Table 8
shows the data of the pairwise comparisons, and the criteria weightings
among the six criteria are: [0.1424, 0.1743, 0.1287, 0.1818, 0.2076,
0.1653].

4.3. Prioritisation of ESG criteria
Further to the optimal criterion weights derived by considering experts’ opinions, four credal ranking diagrams are illustrated in Fig. 3 to
visualise the importance prioritisation of ESG criteria. From the level-1
criteria, it is implied that the social aspect is relatively important in the
logistics industry, compared with the environmental and governance
aspects. Among the sub-criteria of the social dimension, fair labour
practice (S2), human rights in supply chains (S4) and supply chain visibility (S6) are the top-three sub-criteria to be focused. Regarding the
environmental and governance dimensions, reverse logistics (E2) and
anti-corruption/bribery (G5) are the most essential criteria, respectively. Through aggregating the level-1 and level-2 weights together, it
is found that the top-three ESG development areas are S2, E2 and S4
such that the logistics industry should emphasize on the above development areas to further enhance the ESG competitiveness.
4.4. Feasibility of the ESG performance measurement
Through combining the results of company ratings and criteria
weightings, the ESG performance of 10 selected SMEs can be aggregated
by using Equations (3)–(6) as shown in Table 9. The averages of the E, S,
and G performance are 6.98, 5.57, and 5.89, respectively. In other
words, the SMEs can be conveniently classified as the industry leaders
and laggards, as illustrated in Fig. 3. SME 1, 4 and 10 are classified in
region 1, while SME 2, 5, and 6 are included in region VI. Moreover, SME
2, 7, 8, and 9 are classified in regions II, VII, III, and VIII, respectively.

5. Results and discussion
After the case study, it was found that the proposed scheme is
effective in determining ESP performance of SMEs in the logistics industry, which can be a tool for the ESG analytics to spot weaknesses and
potential improvements. In view of the integrated ESG performance
score, SME 5 is the best company in terms of E, S and G in the case study,
but its performance in the governance aspect is behind the average in the
pool. Therefore, the proposed measurement framework can spot the
strengths and weaknesses of SMEs in the logistics industry. Furthermore,
the discussion on the methodological effectiveness and managerial
implication is given as follows.
5.1. Consistency analysis of the pairwise comparisons
To validate the reliability of the multi-criteria decision-making
process with the use of Bayesian BWM, the input-based consistency ratio
(CRI
) can be evaluated, while the corresponding thresholds are dependent on the number of applied criteria and scales (Liang et al., 2020).
The value of CRI of each domain expert in the pairwise comparison
process is obtained by extracting the maximal CRI
j for j criteria per
pairwise comparison, while the value CRI
j is measured as in Equation
(10) where abj, ajw and abw denote the preferences of best-to-others,
others-to-worst and best-to-worst scenarios.
CRI
j =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
⃒
⃒abj × ajw − abw
⃒
⃒
abw × abw − abw
0
(10)
Through analysing the pairwise comparison data in Tables 5–8, it is
found that all the pairwise comparisons conducted in the case study
have passed the thresholds of input-based consistency ratio as in
Table 10. Therefore, the reliability of the pairwise comparison can be
guaranteed to derive the ESG development prioritisation and performance measurement.
5.2. Strategic recommendations in the ESG-driven logistics management
According to the above case study, the focal areas for the ESG
development have been prioritised, namely the fair labour practice,
reverse logistics and human right in supply chains. By doing so, the
social and ethical responsibility can be established for better reputation
in the market, while the companies are not engaged in the violation of
human rights, towards the responsible and sustainable supply chain
management strategy (Asif et al., 2020, 2022; Chen et al., 2020; Lau
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021, 2022). Furthermore, the reverse logistics in
a highly urbanised city are essential to reduce the wastes created from
the logistics and supply chain management, while customer satisfaction
could be improved with the ease of product returning and trade-in.
The proposed ESG scoring framework was applied to ten SMEs,
excluding regions IV and V. In the post-evaluation discussion with the
participating companies, strategies were identified to enhance their ESG
performance in the highly competitive business environment. The
following strategies were recommended for SMEs with weak environmental performance (i.e., SMEs 2, 7, 8, and 9 in regions II, III, VII, and
VIII): consideration of the environmental impact from logistics operations, such as the use of eco-friendly pallets and trucks; avoidance of
unnecessary waste of natural resources and non-biodegradable materials in routine operations, such as the use of styrofoam boxes and
improper disposal of plastic pallets; and balancing cost-effectiveness in
operations management with eco-friendliness to achieve eco-innovative
business strategies.
For SMEs with weak social performance (i.e., SMEs 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10
in regions I, II, and III), which comprise the largest number of enterprises
in this study, demonstrating the social value of logistics companies is the
most challenging task in the current market. To achieve this, both internal and external strategies can be implemented. For example, standard operating procedures and a code of conduct should be developed to
ensure employee well-being and enhance the quality of work. Additionally, social connections with the public can be developed to enable
more external stakeholders, such as customers and the local community,
to understand the key business developments and future plans.
For SMEs with weak governance performance (i.e., SMEs 5, 6, 8, and
9 in regions III, VI, and VIII), appropriate control and monitoring of
business processes and operations should be considered. In the current
digital era, enterprise information systems such as enterprise resource
planning (ERP), warehouse management system (WMS), and transportation management system (TMS) can be employed to facilitate data
transparency and standardization. This would help to establish an
effective governance structure to clearly define the business processes,
roles, and responsibilities of all stakeholders.
Consequently, the proposed ESG scoring framework provides valuable insights into the ESG performance of SMEs in the logistics industry.
Recommendations for improving performance in the environmental,
social, and governance aspects were provided based on the results of the
evaluation. The ESG values and performance of the SMEs can be gradually improved so as to strengthen their competitiveness in the ESGdriven market nowadays. Apart from creating more business opportunities and collaboration with listed companies, the business practices
can become more environmentally, socially and structurally

responsible, aligning to the emerging sustainable development goals
(SDGs) for the society.
5.3. Managerial implications
According to the above methodological design and case study, the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ESG performance measurement scheme for SMEs in the logistics industry are validated. The
transformation of the SMEs in the logistics industry can therefore be
ensured (Anthony Jnr, 2021; Fuka et al., 2022). With the aid of the
proposed scheme in the logistics industry, the implications for future
ESG development can be summarised in two facets.
Firstly, as there is a growing global emphasis on eco-friendly and
socially responsible initiatives, such as carbon neutrality and sustainable
development goals (SDGs), companies are increasingly urged to transform themselves to become more environmentally and socially responsible in order to attract investors and investment funds. Large-scale and
listed companies are eager to develop their own ESG (Environmental,
Social, and Governance) capabilities, and ESG reporting and measurement are becoming more prevalent. However, SMEs with limited human
and capital resources find it challenging to do so without a customized
ESG measurement scheme. Therefore, the proposed scheme has value in
building ESG capabilities for SMEs. In the past, most SMEs in the logistics industry focused on profitability and operational effectiveness,
with cost, quality, and speed being the three major elements benchmarked against competitors. However, in the current green and
responsible business environment, with the aid of the proposed scheme,
awareness of ESG concepts, reporting, and measurement can be raised to
start developing ESG capabilities, thereby effectively sustaining the
businesses.
Secondly, since most listed companies are measured by well-known
ESG metrics, such as Bloomberg’s ESG dataset, to obtain disclosure
scores, they tend to collaborate with ESG-measured vendors and suppliers. In the case of business collaboration between listed companies
and SMEs, the proposed scheme plays an essential role in disclosing the
ESG performance of SMEs in a direct and systematic manner for listed
companies’ selection. As a result, listed companies can conveniently
collaborate with SMEs to maintain or even improve their ESG performance. Therefore, with the aid of the proposed scheme, a healthy ESG
development in the contemporary business environment can be
established.
6. Conclusion
In summary, this study focuses on addressing the practicality of
measuring ESG performance for SMEs in the current business landscape.
To raise awareness and capabilities of ESG among SMEs in the logistics
industry, a customized ESG development prioritisation and performance
measurement framework is proposed, which includes systematic rating
mechanisms and criteria weightings. The proposed scheme’s feasibility
and effectiveness are demonstrated through the case study with several
logistics practitioners. As a result, SMEs can effectively develop their
ESG capabilities and benchmark their ESG performance against their
competitors, especially in the areas of fair labour practice, reverse logistics and human right in supply chains.
For future work, the proposed framework can be further applied in
various countries and cities so as to formulate the customized strategy
for boosting the ESG development. For other highly urbanised cities, the
results of this study can be benchmarked to develop strategic recommendations related to ESG in the logistics industry. In addition, more
SMEs in the logistics industry could be invited to establish a dataset to
facilitate the development of ESG analytics and intelligence to meet the
ongoing SDG requirements.
