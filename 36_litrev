# Literature Review: Real-time analytics, incident response process agility, and enterprise cybersecurity

performance

## Introduction

The field of cybersecurity has become increasingly important in recent years due to the rising number and
sophistication of cyber threats. In order to effectively protect their systems and data, organizations need to
have robust incident response processes in place. Additionally, the ability to perform real-time analytics
plays a crucial role in enhancing incident response process agility and overall enterprise cybersecurity
performance. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between real-time analytics, incident
response process agility, and enterprise cybersecurity performance.

## Real-time Analytics

Real-time analytics refers to the process of analyzing data as soon as it is generated or received, without
any significant delay. This approach is crucial in the realm of cybersecurity, as it allows organizations to
detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner. The ability to perform real-time analytics has
been identified as a significant trend in the business intelligence (BI) industry, with the goal of enabling
non-professional users to solve analytical tasks with little or no help from IT (Savinov, 2014).

## Incident Response Process Agility

Incident response process agility refers to the ability of an organization to quickly and effectively respond
to security incidents. Traditional systems that rely on separate technology stacks for transactional and
analytical workloads often fail to provide the necessary response time and agility required in the face
of rapidly evolving cyber threats (Bowman & Tschan, 2013). Therefore, adopting a real-time analytics
approach can significantly enhance incident response process agility.

## Enterprise Cybersecurity Performance

Enterprise cybersecurity performance refers to the overall effectiveness of an organization's cybersecurity
measures in protecting its systems and data. By leveraging real-time analytics and enhancing incident
response process agility, organizations can improve their cybersecurity performance. Real-time analytics
provides organizations with the ability to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time, minimizing
the potential impact of cyber threats. Additionally, incident response process agility allows organizations
to quickly adapt and respond to new and emerging threats, further strengthening their cybersecurity
performance.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the literature provides valuable insights into the relationship between real-time analytics, incident
response process agility, and enterprise cybersecurity performance, there are still some knowledge gaps
that need to be addressed.
Firstly, further research is needed to explore the specific techniques and technologies that can be employed
to enable real-time analytics in the context of cybersecurity. This includes examining the effectiveness
of different real-time analytics tools and platforms in enhancing incident response process agility and
improving overall cybersecurity performance.
Secondly, additional studies are required to investigate the potential challenges and limitations of implementing real-time analytics in organizations. This includes exploring the impact of data volume, velocity,
and variety on the feasibility and scalability of real-time analytics solutions for cybersecurity.
Lastly, future research should focus on evaluating the long-term impact of real-time analytics and incident
response process agility on enterprise cybersecurity performance. Longitudinal studies can provide
valuable insights into the sustainability and effectiveness of these approaches over time.
By addressing these knowledge gaps and conducting further research in these areas, organizations can
gain a deeper understanding of the benefits, challenges, and best practices associated with leveraging
real-time analytics and enhancing incident response process agility for improved enterprise cybersecurity
performance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, real-time analytics and incident response process agility are key factors in enhancing
enterprise cybersecurity performance. The ability to perform real-time analytics allows organizations
to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner, while incident response process agility
enables quick and effective responses to new and emerging threats. However, further research is needed
to explore the specific techniques, challenges, and long-term impact of these approaches in the context
of cybersecurity. By addressing these knowledge gaps, organizations can strengthen their cybersecurity
measures and protect their systems and data more effectively.
