# Literature Review: Addressing the Lack of Cybersecurity Skills in the European Labor Force Market

Recruiting, retaining, and maintaining a sufficient number of cybersecurity professionals in the workplace
is a constant battle. This challenge extends beyond the technical side of cybersecurity and also encompasses the overlooked area of non-technical managerial-related jobs in the cyber sector. In order to address
this issue, it is crucial to improve the education in cybersecurity to meet the identified needs. This literature
review aims to analyze the current state of cybersecurity curricula in high-level educational institutions
in Europe and the courses provided by cybersecurity trainers in the market. By examining the existing
research findings, this review will highlight the factors associated with increased retention and identify
the knowledge gaps in cybersecurity education.

## Factors Influencing Retention of Cybersecurity Professionals

The retention of cybersecurity professionals is influenced by various factors. According to Totenhagen et
al. (2016), increased retention is generally associated with working in a publicly operated or nonprofit
center that meets accreditation or policy standards, being older, maintaining a higher-level position, having
more tenure and experience, receiving higher wages, and reporting higher job satisfaction. These findings
suggest that creating a supportive and satisfying work environment, offering competitive compensation
packages, and providing opportunities for career advancement can enhance the retention of cybersecurity
professionals.

## Addressing the Support Needs of Cybersecurity Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to address the support needs of cybersecurity professionals. Halcomb et al. (2020) emphasize that key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality,
and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the pandemic. While
this study specifically focuses on healthcare nurses, the findings highlight the importance of addressing
similar concerns among cybersecurity professionals. By addressing health and safety concerns, ensuring
job security, and maintaining care quality, organizations can better support cybersecurity professionals
during challenging times.

## Workplace Accommodations for Recruiting and Retaining Cybersecurity Professionals

To recruit, hire, retain, and promote individuals with physical disabilities, workplace accommodations

play a significant role. Hall et al. (2018) suggest that these accommodations include physical/technological modifications, workplace flexibility, worker autonomy, and strategies promoting workplace
inclusion and integration. While this study does not specifically focus on cybersecurity professionals, the
findings are applicable to the broader context of creating an inclusive and supportive work environment.
Implementing these workplace accommodations can attract and retain cybersecurity professionals with
physical disabilities, thereby enhancing diversity and inclusivity in the cybersecurity workforce.

## Valuing Authenticity in the Cybersecurity Work Environment

In the cybersecurity sector, authenticity is valued as an attractiveness attribute. According to Padkapayeva et al. (2017), authenticity is equally valued as having opportunities for economic and personal
development, and it is significantly more highly valued than other attractiveness dimensions of the work
environment. This finding highlights the importance of creating an authentic work environment in the
cybersecurity sector. By fostering a culture of transparency, trust, and ethical practices, organizations can
enhance the attractiveness of cybersecurity jobs and improve retention rates.

## Workload and Occupational Balance in the Cybersecurity Sector

Cleary et al. (2013) found that occupational therapists reported high workload leading to increased stress,
difficulties in performing their job, and increased job turnover. While this study focuses on occupational
therapists, the findings suggest that workload and occupational balance are significant concerns in the
workplace. In the context of the cybersecurity sector, it is crucial to address these issues to prevent
burnout and turnover among cybersecurity professionals. Organizations should ensure that workload is
manageable, provide resources for maintaining occupational balance, and promote employee well-being
to enhance retention in the cybersecurity workforce.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Despite the existing research findings, there are several knowledge gaps in the field of cybersecurity
education and workforce development. Firstly, there is a need to investigate the specific topics that are
missing within the cybersecurity curricula of high-level educational institutions in Europe. By identifying
these gaps, educational institutions can update their curricula to better align with the evolving needs of
the cybersecurity industry.
Secondly, further research is required to examine the effectiveness of the courses provided by cybersecurity trainers on the market. By evaluating the content, delivery methods, and outcomes of these
courses, organizations can make informed decisions about which training programs to invest in for their

cybersecurity professionals.
Lastly, it is essential to explore the intersection of technical and non-technical managerial-related jobs in
the cybersecurity sector. This includes understanding the specific skill sets required for managerial roles
in cybersecurity and developing strategies to attract and retain professionals in these positions.
In conclusion, addressing the lack of cybersecurity skills in the European labor force market requires a
comprehensive approach. By integrating the research findings, this literature review highlights the factors
influencing retention, the support needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace accommodations, the
value of authenticity, and the importance of workload and occupational balance. The identified knowledge
gaps suggest the need for further research to improve cybersecurity education and workforce development.
By filling these gaps and implementing evidence-based strategies, organizations can recruit, retain, and
maintain a sufficient number of cybersecurity professionals in the workplace.
