Abstract
The advancement and the proliferation of information systems among enterprises have given rise to
understanding cybersecurity. Cybersecurity practices provide a set of techniques and procedures to
protect the systems, networks, programs and data from attack, damage, or unauthorised access. Such
cybersecurity practices vary and are applied differently to different types of enterprises. The purpose of
this research is to compare the critical cybersecurity threats and practices in the cloud context among
micro, small, and medium enterprises. By conducting a survey among 289 micro, small and mediumsized enterprises in Australia, this study highlights the significant differences in their cloud security
practices. It also concludes that future studies that focus on cybersecurity issues and practices in the
context of cloud computing should pay attention to these differences.

1 Introduction
The landscape of cloud computing has significantly changed over the last decade with more cloud service
providers offering numerous services, and cloud infrastructures (Goode et al. 2015; Pahl et al. 2017;
Walther et al. 2018). However, the advancement of such technologies creates various issues and
challenges for enterprises (Dolawattha et al. 2020; Kaluarachchi et al. 2020; Sedera and Lokuge 2019;
Varghese and Buyya 2018). For example, issues such as security, governance, cost management, and
resource management are some of the prominent ones. In the traditional cloud, there are significant
security risks related to data storage and hosting of multiple users, mitigated by robust mechanisms to
guarantee user and user data isolation (Chejerla and Madria 2017; Nagahawatta et al. 2021a). The
advancement of fog computing ecosystem further creates more issues as the risks are of more significant
concern since a wide range of nodes are accessible to users (Gupta et al. 2013; Varghese and Buyya
2018). In addition, selection of the right cloud products and services may also present a challenge, and
organisations are presented with too many choices (Pahl et al. 2017).
The problem is that addressing trust, privacy, and security issues in advanced technology remains a
challenge because it needs a combination of technological and non-technical approaches that often lie
outside the governance of an organisation (Kaluarachchi et al. 2020; Lowry et al. 2017; Moody et al.
2018). Privacy is one of the core issues in the use of information technology (IT), including the need for
policy components during integration, protect identity information and transaction histories (Khayer et
al. 2020). Customers may be concerned about information stored in the cloud being accessed by others
anywhere in the world (Nagahawatta et al. 2020; Ratten 2014). Cloud security refers to the controls,
services and policies that protect cloud applications, infrastructure, and data from threats (Zissis and
Lekkas 2012). Cyber-attacks can be caused due to negligence and ignorance which is intolerable, making
this a primary area to be reviewed (Nagahawatta et al. 2021b).
However, application of such practices and their challenges may vary depending on the size of the
enterprise. For example, the nature of the resources, the extent of enterprise and the type of the business
determines the severity of the challenges and the nature of the practices. This paper focuses on the
cybersecurity practices and issues faced by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs play a
significant part in the economic progress of any nation in the world (Wong and Aspinwall 2004), and
they have attracted increasing and strong attention from the Australian government. Australian SMEs
comprise 95% of businesses and over 57% of gross domestic product (GDP) contribution. Large
Australian enterprises adopt more than 70% of commercial payment cloud computing services;
however, the adoption of SMEs is less than 40% due to various challenges (Australian Bureau of
Statistics, 2019). Recent studies in Australia on SMEs cloud computing adoption indicate that security
challenges are one of the critical factors that discourages SMEs to adopt cloud computing (e.g., Asiaei
and Rahim 2019; Senarathna et al. 2018).
While analysing the SME segment, it is evident that prior research considers them as one segment with
common characteristics. Interestingly, in recent years, research highlights the need to analyse them
separately and SMEs were further analysed under micro, small and medium sized enterprises. It is
always a sensitive issue to make general claims about SMEs, because their diversity may be their most
important characteristic (Belás et al. 2015). For example, among the micro, small, and medium
enterprises, medium enterprises can technically distinguish themselves better than micro and small
firms (Gupta and Barua 2016). As such, a new area of research focus has been established on diversity
within the SME segment (Belás et al. 2015). These categories are classified in terms of the number of
employees (Gupta et al. 2015), capital investments, annual turnover (Belás et al. 2015; Gibson and Vaart
2008). As a result of these distinguishing characteristics, it seems reasonable to assume that
cybersecurity issues and practices may vary by SME enterprise size. However, a limited literature in this
area has been devoted to studying the cybersecurity issues and practices of these different categories.
Therefore, this study will address this research gap by assessing the differences in cybersecurity
practices and issues among micro, small, and medium enterprises. To analyse this, in this study we
employed a quantitative approach to examine cybersecurity issues and practices in a cloud context
among Australian micro, small and medium enterprises.
The paper is structured as follows. The following section will provide the background of the study by
providing related work in this domain. The third section provides the methodology used for the data
collection and analysis. Then, the fourth section provides the overview of the results, and a discussion is

research areas.
2 Related Work
While cloud computing provides significant business benefits and opportunities, it also presents
security, privacy, and trust related challenges, particularly for SMEs (Ayong and Naidoo 2019; Khayer
et al. 2020; Nagahawatta and Warren 2020; Salim et al. 2015). A survey undertaken by the Australian
Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) among Australian SMEs show an increasing number and extent of cyberattacks targeting SMEs. This further highlights the importance of understanding cybersecurity practices
among different categories of Australian SMEs (ACSC 2020).
2.1 Characteristics of SME Categories
There is no generally accepted definition for SMEs, and the existing definitions vary from country to
country, from sector to sector, over time, even among institutions within a single country. Generally, the
definition of SMEs entails the criteria such as the value of capital, amount of revenue, number of
employees, estimate of fixed assets, and the nature of the organisation or combination of those factors.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) defines SMEs as enterprises with 1 to 199 employees. There
are three types of SMEs: (i) micro businesses which have fewer than 4 employees, (ii) small businesses
with 5 to 19 employees and (iii) medium businesses with 20 to 199 employees (ABS 2019). Several
previous studies indicated that size of the enterprise (i.e., micro, small and medium enterprises) is
considered as one of the fundamental variables in explaining enterprise behaviour (Heidt et al. 2019;
Redondo and Fierro 2007). Paik (2011) indicated that company size is a leading factor for enterprise
performance. The enterprise size is a factor commonly used to set boundaries between segments of
enterprises (Tornatzky and Fleischer 1990). Cataldo, Pino and McQueen (2020) suggested that variation
in IT adoption exists among micro, small, and medium enterprises.
As discussed, SMEs generally vary from large enterprises in terms of their capacity, structure, and
business size (Sedera 2016). For SMEs, cost is a crucial issue as they have limited financial resources to
spend on their IT facilities. In general, SMEs possess problems such as lack of IT resources, lack of IT
professionals and security systems (Doherty 2015; Khayer et al. 2020). However, SMEs have closer
communication between employees and management, and the ability to execute and implement
decisions quickly. The key challenge that SMEs face is keeping their costs under control and hence, many
cannot allocate much of their budget to IT. Anecdotal studies show that there exist some important
similarities and differences between micro, small and medium enterprises regarding the cybersecurity
issues and practices associated with the cloud environment.
A study by Rahayu and Day (2015) found that medium enterprises are more willing to adopt the Internet
for business use compared to smaller and micro sized enterprises. Yeboah-Boateng and Essandoh
(2014) found that enterprise size has a significantly positive relationship with cloud computing
adoption. SMEs tend to have a small management team and centralised management style. The manager
of an SME is usually the business owner and has a strong influence on the enterprise’s decision making
(Heidt et al. 2019). Amini and Bakri (2015) state that SMEs’ IT infrastructure is not well established
compared to that of larger enterprises. Furthermore, they have limited resources and often inconsistent
revenue (Heidt et al. 2019; Mijnhardt et al. 2016). Amini and Bakri (2015) suggest that despite these
differences, different types of SMEs have common features such as inadequate planning,
unsophisticated software, or IT applications that tended to have greater risks and uncertainty compared
with large organisations. Further, SMEs perceive those characteristics of security and privacy in the
cloud to be more complicated and not as easy to identify when compared to large organisations.
2.2 Cybersecurity Threats and Vulnerabilities
The scope of cybersecurity issues extends to the security of IT systems deployed in enterprises as well as
to the broader digital networks including critical national infrastructures (Ani 2017). Unfortunately,
preliminary security surveys by government such as ACSC (2020) show an increasing number of cyber
threats targeting enterprises, but with a lack of information about the characteristics of the attacks and
their possible impacts. Therefore, it is important to analyse existing cybersecurity threats,
vulnerabilities, and their solutions with a comprehensive view of the cybersecurity, to gain a complete
picture of the cybersecurity practices in relation to SMEs. New technologies offer vital business
opportunities and benefits. However, it provides, privacy, security, and risk issues, particularly for SMEs
(Mijnhardt et al. 2016).

The cybersecurity attacks and threats are diverse in terms of motivation and technological exploits.
Ranging from insider attacks motivated by malice to the accidental misconfiguration of enterprise
networks, from a lack of contingency planning to automated exploitation of known security
vulnerabilities (Sinha et al. 2019). The loss of user control can be problematic in situations such as data
damage or misuse, unauthorised access, unavailability, or infrastructure failure (Ani 2017). Due to the
lack of awareness SMEs can face several vulnerabilities. For instance, a lack of competence can make
any enterprise vulnerable to social engineering attacks like phishing. If an employee is not competent
enough to differentiate a legitimate business email from a phishing email, it puts an organisation at risk
(Symantec 2019). Furthermore, the lack of concern for professional development and failing to update
personal knowledge, can lead to a lack of awareness of current cyber threats such as DDoS (Distributed
Denial of Service) attacks, social engineering, hacktivism, and credential harvesting malware (ACSC
2020). This reveals that employees do not practice due diligence, which could lead to a multitude of
financial and legal risks.
2.3 Cybersecurity and Australian SMEs
According to the ACSC, cybercrime is a threat to Australia’s national and economic prosperity, with
cybercrime expertise improving and tradecraft being adapted to target specific businesses. Cybercrime
will continue to be an attractive option for criminals, as it enables them to generate large profits with a
low risk of identification and interdiction (ACSC 2020). The ACSC (2020) report highlighted that
Australian SMEs know cybersecurity is important regardless of how they rate their understanding of
cybersecurity. However, they face significant barriers when attempting to implement good cybersecurity
practices in particularly for micro firms. These barriers include limited budgets, an absence of IT staff
for support, the complex field of cybersecurity, challenges in understanding and implementing security
measures, underestimating the risk and consequences of a cyber incident, and a gap in planning for, and
responding to, cyber incidents. Further, these barriers can vary among the micro, small and medium
enterprises.
SMEs are embracing emerging technologies, with 84% of Australian SMEs having adopted online
services and relying on up to 30 separate technologies (Cynch 2021). Most medium firms plan to
maintain or increase their investment in the cyber fitness of their business. Australian SMEs recognise
the need to look beyond technical solutions when addressing their risks, and 72% of Australian SMEs
consider cybersecurity as very important (Cynch 2021). The Australian Information Security Association
(AISA) identifies the lack of adequate cybersecurity skills and examines the impact of COVID-19 among
micro, small and medium enterprises in New South Wales (NSW). NSW service providers have found it
very difficult to attract and retain people with skills in strategy, risk and governance, compliance, and
consultancy (AISA 2021). For example, ACSC found that an Australian SME network had been attacked
by a malicious cyber adversary and that the SME network had links to national security projects.
According to the ACSC analysis, the adversary attacker had access to the SME network for a long period
of time and was able to download a vast amount of data. The analysis showed that the adversary was
able to gain access to the company’s network by misusing an internet-facing server, and then had moved
across the entire network with the support of administrative credentials. This enabled the attacker to
install multiple web shells in the victims’ network; a script was uploaded to a webserver empowering
remote administration of the machine, to obtain and retain future access. An investigation revealed that
‘sensitive data was freely accessible due to seemingly no encryption or access control measures being in
place’, so sensitive data was found to be freely accessible due to the apparent absence of encryption or
access control measures. The key finding was that the SME did not correctly configure the security
features of their systems (ACSC 2018). This highlights that privacy, trust, and security challenges in
cloud environments remain a challenge, in particularly for SMEs.
3 Research Method
This study employed a descriptive analysis methodology to examine what key cybersecurity threats,
vulnerabilities, and security practices adopted in cloud context among Australian micro, small and
medium enterprises. Descriptive statistics describes the characteristics of a data set (Amrhein et al.
2019). As the preliminary stage, we analysed these descriptive statistics to get an understanding about
the similarities and the differences of cyber practices among SME categories. The unit of analysis for
this study is the organisation, in particularly Australian SMEs, which are widely distributed
geographically throughout all Australian states and territories. In Australia, an estimated 95.5% of SMEs
are connected to an Internet service (ACMA 2010). The survey instrument containing appropriate
measures and demographics was designed and thoroughly tested. The survey instrument comprised of
two sections: (i) cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in the use of cloud computing, (ii)

cybersecurity solutions for cloud computing. Accordingly, the target population for this quantitative
study consisted of IT related decision makers (IT managers or decision makers in the IT section or other
authorities) from different types of SMEs in Australia, who were responsible for and authorised to make
policy decisions and technology acquisition for their business. The main study was conducted, where
data were collected from decision makers (i.e., owner, IT manager or decision-maker in the IT section)
in SMEs. An online survey tool was used to collect data. The survey instrument was developed and
designed using Qualtrics survey software. Qualtrics is a widely used online software survey platform.
The survey link was shared among a group of selected SMEs (1,410 in total) to align with the convenient
sampling technique. From this, 339 responses were received, and 289 valid responses were used for
subsequent data analysis.

Table 1. Demographic characteristics of responding organisations
The following demographic characteristics of these responses were considered: the title or position of
respondents, the organisations size, where the business operated (state or territory), and cloud usage.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics that were used. The employment profile of the respondents
was examined. Most of the respondents (33.6%, n=97) hold the ownership position of organisation. The
remaining 67% other decision makers such as chief executive officer (CEO) (7.3%, n=21), chief
information officer (CIO) (14.5%, n=42), chief security officer (CSO) (3.8%, n=11), IT manager (9.7,
n=28%), IT executive (18.3%, n=53), and other (12.8%, n=37). According to the organisational profile
based on total number of employees at the time of this research 57.4% (n=166) of respondents are from
organisations within the range of 1 to 4 employees, 24.6% in the range of 5 to 19 employees, and 18% are
in the range of 20 to 199 employees. The states with larger populations provided higher response rates.
There are 28.7% (n=83) of the respondents who from New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC) (24.6%;
n=75), Queensland (QLD) (19.7%; n=57). The remaining organisations came from West Australia (WA)
(12.2%), South Australia (SA) (7.6%), Tasmania (TAS) (3.8%), Northern Territory (NT) (1%), and the
Australian Capital Territory (ACT) (2.4%). In summary, the analysis of the demographic characteristics
of the surveyed SMEs provides insight into the general profile of such SMEs. The surveyed SMEs are
also in diverse industries with respect to a range of sizes and the industry type.

4 Data Analyses and Results
4.1 Cloud Security Threats and Vulnerabilities
The objective of this study was to understand what security issues are related to cloud computing face
by three categories within the SME classification. Cross tabulation analyses were conducted by
examining relationships between security threats and vulnerabilities by size of enterprise (Table 2). It
consisted of several areas: (i) unauthorised access, (ii) insecure interfaces (APIs), (iii) external sharing
of data, (iv) hijacking of accounts, services, or traffic, (v) malicious insiders, (vi) malware/ phishing/
ransomware, (vii) misconfiguration of the cloud platform, and (viii) denial of service attacks and other
not specified in the list.

Table 2. Cloud security threats and vulnerabilities
The data were analysed and compared to identify significant differences of threats and vulnerabilities,
and the results were generated into tabular format. These threats and vulnerabilities accounted for a
high proportion in the micro sized enterprises (unauthorised access, 21.9%; external sharing of data,
18%; insecure interfaces, 14.5%; malware/phishing/ransomware, 13.8%) and the small (unauthorised
access, 19.8%; external sharing of data, 15.3%; hijacking of accounts services or traffic, 14.3%; insecure
interfaces, 11.1%; misconfiguration of the cloud platform, 11.1%; malware/phishing/ ransomware,
10.6%), but some threats and vulnerabilities are significant drop in the medium size organisations
(unauthorised access, 20.6%; external sharing of data, 13.7%; malicious insiders, 13%). Medium sized
enterprises are more than twice as likely to have a malicious insider attack when compared to a micro
business. But there are no differences between micro and small, nor between small and medium sized
businesses (x2 = 6.96, p < 0.05). All other threats and vulnerabilities share the almost same pattern
across sized of organisations.
4.2 Cloud Security Practices
In order to understand how SMEs face cloud security practices for different types of SMEs, cross
tabulation analyses were conducted by examining relationships between security solutions by type of
enterprise. It consisted of several areas: (i) data encryption, (ii) encrypted cloud service, (iii) security
information event management, (iv) trained Cloud security professional, (v) vulnerability assessment,
(vi) access control, (vii) log management and analytics, (viii) privileged access management, (ix) data
leakage prevention and (x) security insurance and other not specified in the list. The data were analysed
and compared to identify significant differences of security solutions, and the results were generated in

Table 3. Cloud security practices
SMEs are considered to have better protection against cloud computing threats if they are using
encrypted cloud service and data encryption. Cloud security solutions accounted for a lower proportion
in micro sized organisations (encrypted cloud service, 18.4%; access control, 13.7%; security insurance,
11.1%) and the small (encrypted cloud service, 15.7%; data encryption, 14.9%; trained cloud security
professional, 12.6%; security information event management, 10.7%; access control, 10.7%). Data
encryption and trained cloud security professionals were found in a significantly higher percentages of
medium and small sized organisations (data encryption, 18.1%; encrypted cloud service, 14%; trained
cloud security professional, 13.2%; security information event management, 12.3%). Medium sized
organisations reveal a higher percentage of responses for data encryption, trained Cloud security
professionals, and security information event management (x2 = 7.26, p < 0.05; x2 = 5.08, p < 0.05; x2
= 8.32, p < 0.01, respectively) and small-sized organisations for vulnerability assessment (x2 = 4.97, p <
0.05) which were significant across the size of the enterprises. In addition, security solutions indicating
the use of data leakage prevention technologies were higher for micro sized businesses when compared
to both small and medium sized businesses (x2 = 5.02, p < 0.05).
5 Discussion
Cloud computing is a combination of many existing and emerging technologies like the Internet,
networking, operating systems, hardware, software, middleware, virtualisation, and multi-tenancy (Tsai
et a. 2010). When cloud computing integrates all of the above technologies, the existing challenges and
issues become even more challenging and demanding. If the data stored in cloud computing is sensitive,
then cybersecurity becomes an utmost important aspect. The cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities
related to cloud computing that affect SMEs, may differ from large enterprises because of unique
contexts. This study found that the major cybersecurity issues in the context of cloud computing that are
related to SMEs, include unauthorised access, external sharing of data, malware, phishing, ransomware,
misconfiguration of the cloud platform, malicious insiders and insecure interfaces being exploited,
among others. The risks of data loss and untrusted server manipulation are key issues faced by SMEs
operating in the cloud environment, and such instances threaten the data integrity of organisations.
Malicious insiders, malware, phishing, and ransomware present significant threats for SMEs in relation
to the availability of information and information systems in the cloud, as well as the cost of using the
technology.
Cybersecurity issues include a lack of adequate security standards to ensure robust security for
enterprises, trust issues when working over the Internet, and compliance issues. For the cloud
infrastructure, the major security issues for SMEs include insecure API interfaces, security

misconfiguration, server location and data backup, as well as the multi-tenancy characteristics of the
cloud environment. The study found that the major cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities related to
cloud computing does not depend on the size of the businesses, with the exception of threats from
malicious insiders. Malicious insiders in the cloud may be current or former employees, contractors, or
a trusted service provider from the cloud who misuses their authority to access critical assets in the cloud
without permission from the organisation. Insider threats are a major security issue for any
organisation. A malicious insider already has authorised access to an organisation’s network and some
of the sensitive resources that it contains. Medium sized firms can have many third-party vendors with
granted access to the organisation’s internal networks, making the network even more vulnerable to
security breaches compared to micro and small businesses. In addition, illegal practices related to IT are
much easier to log, notice, and correct on a smaller network than on a network with many employees.
This study also examined the current cybersecurity practices, techniques, and challenges against
security issues in the cloud computing context. This study found that the most common security
methods used by enterprises include data encryption, security information event management, trained
cloud security professionals, vulnerability assessment, access control, privileged access management as
well as data leakage prevention. However, there was no significant difference for encrypted cloud
service, access control, privileged access management, log management and analytics and security
insurance between micro, small and medium sized enterprises. This study reveals that in terms of
security practices and techniques such data encryption, security information event management, trained
cloud security professionals, vulnerability assessment and data leakage prevention are all experienced
significantly differently between medium, small, and micro enterprises. SMEs reported better security
practices and techniques on data encryption, security information event management, trained cloud
security professionals, and vulnerability assessment than the micro firms. However, micro industries
practiced better data leakage prevention when compared to the other two larger sized industries. This
suggests that micro and small firms are less affected by this aspect of security when compared to
medium sized enterprises. Micro enterprises often lack dedicated cybersecurity resources, lack funds,
time and expertise to protect against cyber-threats. This makes them especially vulnerable to highly
adaptable and cunning cybercriminals who look to exploit vulnerable micro businesses. Micro and small
enterprises in Australia have a somewhat weak understanding of cybersecurity, control methods and
security technologies in a cloud context, and they typically depend on third parties.
6 Conclusion
This study reveals that Australian SMEs are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and further, they do not follow
good cybersecurity practices. The study findings have both theoretical and practical contributions,
especially with constant technological advances and emerging cybersecurity threats. Security threats
and vulnerabilities, as well as opportunities, apply to many SMEs, so this investigative work should be
continued. The study adds to the growing body of literature on security threats and vulnerabilities to
enterprises in cloud environments by examining the priority threats unique to all sizes of small, medium
and micro sized enterprises. This study found significant differences in cybersecurity practices among
micro, small, and medium enterprises. For example, data encryption, security information event
management, trained cloud security professionals, vulnerability assessment, access control, privileged
access management and data leakage prevention all exhibit lower levels of impact for micro and small
sized firms, when compared to medium sized firms. However, and interestingly, micro sized enterprises
exhibit higher levels of data leakage prevention compared to small and medium sized enterprises.
The main contribution of this paper was highlighting the diversity of cybersecurity issues and practices
by dividing the sample into three segments namely micro, small, and medium. The study bridges the
research gap and provides insightful evidence on these issues, especially within the context of Australian
businesses of this size. Results indicate that micro, small and medium sized enterprises face similar
kinds of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, but significant differences in their cloud security
practices are revealed. A possible reason for this might be due to resource limitations, or perhaps they
may face inadequate expertise regarding cloud computing and its practices. Also, generally SMEs are
less concerned about security and privacy threats, in part because they do not have dedicated IT staff
and the associated knowledge. This study has several practical contributions. The new understandings
(i.e., that security and privacy factors do not impose significant influences on SMEs) enable SMEs, cloud
service providers, IT practitioners and policy makers to concentrate on other critical factors that have
more impact on cloud computing adoption, such as broadband affordability and speed. As SMEs are
generally not capable of significant investment on IT, it is essential for cloud service providers,
professional bodies, and the government to devise strategies for the widespread adoption of cloud

computing for these businesses. For cloud service providers it is important to identify the differences
among different SMEs and provide purpose driven, bespoke cybersecurity solutions.
This research focuses only on SMEs within Australia and should be considered carefully for other
regions. For example, results may not be directly applicable to SMEs from other parts of the world.
Hence, this study would have benefited from the inclusion of perspectives of SMEs from other countries.
Further, this study is limited in terms of its quantitative data. Qualitative research, such as case studies
and longitudinal studies, are required to gain a more meaningful understanding of this phenomenon.
Future research could focus on case studies to explore security and privacy impacts among SMEs.
Furthermore, future studies could focus on mitigation strategies for security and privacy issues.
