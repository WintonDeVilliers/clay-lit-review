# Literature Review: Opportunities Challenges and Implications of Generative Conversational AI for Research Practice and Policy

## Introduction

Generative Conversational AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, has emerged as a powerful tool with the capacity
to carry out remarkably complex tasks. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the potential
opportunities, challenges, and implications of generative conversational AI in various domains, including
healthcare education, research, and practice. By synthesizing the existing research findings, this review
aims to shed light on the promising perspectives of ChatGPT while also addressing valid concerns
associated with its use.

## Potential Applications in Health Care Education, Research, and Practice

The potential applications of ChatGPT in healthcare education, research, and practice have been widely
recognized. Sallam (2023) conducted a systematic review and highlighted the promising perspectives of
ChatGPT in these domains. The author emphasized that ChatGPT can contribute to healthcare education
by providing personalized learning experiences and facilitating knowledge exchange among students
and healthcare professionals. Furthermore, ChatGPT can assist in medical research by automating data
analysis, literature review, and hypothesis generation. In healthcare practice, ChatGPT can support clinical
decision-making, patient triage, and telemedicine consultations. However, the author cautions that valid
concerns associated with the use of ChatGPT in healthcare should be proactively examined and addressed
to ensure its safe and effective implementation.

## Capacity and Growth of ChatGPT

ChatGPT has taken the world by surprise with its sophisticated capacity to perform complex tasks. Its
ability to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text has garnered significant attention and
appreciation (Semantic Scholar, 2023). The exponential growth of ChatGPT is evident from the fact
that it has reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date
(Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023). This growth reflects the widespread adoption and acceptance of ChatGPT
as a valuable tool in various domains, including education, research, and practice.

## Revolutionizing Medical Writing

One specific area where ChatGPT can have a transformative impact is medical writing. Liu, Lee,
and Lee (2020) argue that ChatGPT can revolutionize the process of medical writing by making it
quick and time-efficient. The authors highlight that medical writing often involves complex terminology

and extensive literature review, which can be time-consuming for healthcare professionals. The use of
ChatGPT can automate the generation of medical documents, such as research papers, case reports,
and clinical guidelines, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and improving overall
productivity.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the potential applications of ChatGPT in healthcare education, research, and practice are promising,
several knowledge gaps need to be addressed through future research. Firstly, there is a need for studies
that examine the ethical implications of using generative conversational AI in healthcare. The ethical
considerations surrounding data privacy, bias, accountability, and informed consent should be thoroughly
investigated to ensure responsible use of ChatGPT in healthcare settings.
Secondly, the effectiveness and accuracy of ChatGPT in healthcare decision-making need to be further
evaluated. It is important to determine the extent to which ChatGPT can provide reliable clinical
recommendations and whether its outputs align with established medical guidelines and best practices.
Comparative studies that assess the performance of ChatGPT against human experts or other AI models
can provide valuable insights in this regard.
Furthermore, research is needed to explore the impact of ChatGPT on healthcare professionals' roles
and responsibilities. As ChatGPT automates certain tasks, it is crucial to understand how this affects
the workflow, job satisfaction, and professional development of healthcare professionals. Additionally,
studies should investigate the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare professionals towards ChatGPT, as
their acceptance and willingness to adopt this technology will determine its successful integration into
healthcare practice.
Lastly, the potential risks and limitations of ChatGPT in healthcare should be thoroughly investigated.
This includes examining its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, potential biases in generated responses,
and the impact of system errors or malfunctions on patient safety. Understanding and mitigating these
risks is essential for ensuring the safe and reliable use of ChatGPT in healthcare settings.
In conclusion, generative conversational AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, presents numerous opportunities
for healthcare education, research, and practice. However, it is crucial to address valid concerns and
knowledge gaps to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Future research should focus on investigating the ethical implications, evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness, exploring the impact on
healthcare professionals, and mitigating the risks associated with ChatGPT in healthcare. By addressing
these research directions, the full potential of ChatGPT can be realized in enhancing healthcare outcomes
and improving patient care.
