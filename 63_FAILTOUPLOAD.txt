1. Introduction
The operations function exists to create and deliver services
and products [1], and operations management is the practice of
management decision-making and systems design that covers
the input-process-output cycle. The flow of operations –
materials flow, or information flow – from the supplier to the
customer, constitutes the most important task for manufacturing
companies and, through its link to cash flow, it is one of the
areas of management with the highest impact on business
results [2]. Time is one of the most valuable resources with
respect to business effectivity, where the minimization of
production time ensures higher client satisfaction [3].
Eliminating wastes of both time and resources helps improve
manufacturing systems [4]. Moreover, the reduction of
operational costs while preserving a product’s full value is
crucial to defining lean manufacturing [5]. Lean Manufacturing
is amongst the most researched topics in the modern area of
operations management [6]. The origins of lean have been
traced back in time far beyond the automotive era yet is
commonly associated with the power of the Toyota Production
System (TPS) and lean models of operational management.
Lean manufacturing is evolving to become a method of
maximizing a company’s efficiency and reducing its waste with
respect to digital and physical business processes [7]. Any
actions or resources that don’t benefit the customer or client

Abstract
This paper conducts a review of the literature to identify associations in operations between Industry 4.0 capabilities such as Additive
Manufacturing, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Robots, Big Data, Cloud Computing, IIoT, Simulation, and Systems Integration wit h the
commonly identified lean manufacturing wastes of Trans port, Inventory, Movement, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects, and
Underutilized skills. The paper documents research that links various capabilities and wastes, including how IIoT can be used to reduce defects
in manufacturing, and how it can mitigate overproduction across industries. There is also evidence that big data implementation in manufacturing
has positive effects on reducing waiting times across the manufacturing process and delivery, and that cloud computing techno logies guarantee
better estimates for product and predicted inventory amounts. The research finds impacts on the social aspect of manufacturing by how augmented
reality tools are increasingly used in the manufacturing sector to improve workers’ knowledge, skills, and abilities, and that simulation software
applications are capable of decreasing operator motion wastes. The paper concludes that there is a clear benefit for SMEs in using Industry 4.0
in lean implementation journeys, and it supports the efforts of manufacturing organizations to become leaner using Industry 4.0 capabilities and
solutions.

directly are considered waste [8]. There are seven commonly
identified types of manufacturing waste which are defects,
overproduction, waiting, transportation, overprocessing, and
inventory. Moreover, “underutilized skills” have been added to
the manufacturing waste category by various authors [9.10].
Beginning in 2011, the digitalization of manufacturing has
impacted the industrial revolution, allowing business
processing to happen in real-time [11, 12]. The fourth industrial
revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is a group of
technological advances used to increase business digitization
and to enable businessesto be a part of an interconnected world
[13]. Industry 4.0 is often categorized by nine enablers, these
are the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Autonomous Robots,
Additive Manufacturing, Cloud Computing, Simulation,
Cybersecurity, Augmented Reality, and Systems Integration
[14]. Research suggests that businesses will see bigger benefits
with the introduction of Industry 4.0. However, Small &
Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) can suffer from the
introduction, due to high investment costs and incorrect scope
and planning within its implementation [15].
Industry 4.0 has been attributed to increased levels of
manufacturing productivity, decreased lead times, and
improved efficacy due to growing amounts of technology in the
industrial and manufacturing fields [16, 17, 18]. It has also been
found to support the implementation of Just in Time systems
through the digitalizing of the supply chain to enable timely and
accurate communication regarding inventory location and
levels [19] and detecting bottlenecks to ensure continuous flow
[20]. Industry 4.0 capabilities and technologies can also be used
to support the implementation of lean manufacturing through
the identification of manufacturing wastes in the manufacturing
system [21]. Lean manufacturing waste can be defined as the
non-use, loss, or over-use of digital and physical business
technologies. This includes but is not limited to simulations,
virtual models, and data analytic systems [7].
The relationship between Industry 4.0 and lean
manufacturing is increasingly explored in the operations
management literature [22, 23, 24, 25]. Although different in
many ways, both concepts share the same goal or increasing
added value [26].Previous studies have explored how JIT can
be supported by a digital supply chain [27], that Jidoka can be
improved via enhanced information sharing using the Internet
of Things [24], and Quality can be enhanced by digitizing the
quality control process [28]. This paper sets out to answer the
question of ‘what are the associations between lean
manufacturing waste and Industry 4.0’, and to explore how the
various Industry 4.0 capabilities can be used to identify and
eliminate the different types of lean wastes in manufacturing.
Identification of the wastes will generate more targeted and
efficient approaches in the lean implementation journey, and
the elimination will further enhance the value provided from
within the manufacturing system. The following section
explains the methodology applied, which is followed by the
research Findings section, and finally the Conclusions section.
2. Methodology
The literature review performed for this paper used
SCOPUS as the database to identify the relevant studies.
Combinations of the following keywords were used to identify
the pool of papers to be screened, “lean manufacturing”,
“wastes”, Industry 4.0”, and “digital”. An excess of 200 papers
were identified and screened at the abstract stage.A total of 53
papers, published between the years of 2008 and 2021, were
chosen as relevant for this study to explore how Industry 4.0
capabilities can be used to identify and eliminatelean wastes in
manufacturing systems. Despite of the great interest in the
concept of Industry 4.0 worldwide, there is no one formally
respected definition for it [29], and although there are many
technologies and capabilities directly related to the
digitalization of manufacturing there still is a lack of agreed
upon classification in the literature. As such, the key Industry
4.0 capabilities identified and used in this research are the
Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality, Autonomous
Robots, Big Data, Cloud Computing, the Industrial Internet of
Things (IIoT), Simulation, and Systems Integration. Whereas
the lean manufacturing wastes identified and included were
Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Transportation,
Overprocessing, Inventory, Underutilized skills, and Motion.
The following section describes the different types of lean
wastes and how the various Industry 4.0 capabilities can
support in their identification within manufacturing systems.
3. Findings
3.1.Defects,IIoT, and Autonomous Robots
Defect waste is producing any product that is not suitable for
use for whatever reason such as defective materials and
components or produced not per specification [30]. The
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) reduces information defects
and increases product traceability [31, 32]. In the steel industry,
Cao et al. [33] tested the use of a blockchain platform that
allows producers, logistics services providers, and consumers
to participate in information certification on improving steel
products’ information integrity and traceability. Results
indicated that stakeholders in the steel industry were able to
certify steel products, and express confidence in the
information provided on the platform helping them reduce
existing information defects. The authors suggested the
universalization of blockchain technology in other complex
industries to mitigate the information deficiency and defects
problem. Potyrailo [34] proposed an IIoT based sensing
technology for detecting gases in industrial and clinical
environments. Advanced sensors that read many variables, and
act autonomously can reduce risks of gases leaks or unexpected
overflows. The author concluded with the suggestion that the
sensors allow manufacturers to maintain smooth production
without dealing with defective manufacturing environments.
Velandia et al. [35] investigated the problem of defects in
crankshafts manufacturing. They proposed a feasible solution
capable of reducing process and product defects along the
assembly line. The authors recommended the placement of
radio-frequency identifiers on bolts along the assembly line.
They also suggested the placement of a reading antenna on the
gantry overlooking every step of the manufacturing process
line. A reading of bolts will be taken at every stage, and
immediate corrections will be made once any deviation is

detected and flagged by the automated system. The Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) capability has shown to have a clear
impact on the identification of defective products and
components at the various stages of production. Whereas the
use of autonomous robots on the floor, which are machines
programmed to achieve a task or a collection of functions in the
manufacturing process [36], increases standardization and
mitigates the occurrence of errors and defects on the production
line, and stations. This helps the manufacturer achieve a better
integration level, as well as flow improvement[37, 38].
3.2.Overproduction and IIoT
Overproduction waste is manufacturing extra products that
are not required or have no customer demand [30], it is a major
cause of other types of manufacturing wastes including
inventory and waiting. Ghouat et al. [39] suggested that
Industry 4.0 carries significant improvements on the production
systems of manufacturers. First, the use of IIoT increases the
real-time data collection of customer needs making the
manufacturing of only desired products realized. Second, the
enhancement of machine-to-machine communication increases
optimal production generating only needed amounts requested
by customers. Xu and Chen [40] proposed an IIoT based
framework to enhance the implementation of Just-in-Time
manufacturing, and thus avoid overproduction. The authors
identified the frequently cited challenges surrounding the
application of JIT in manufacturing settings. Then, the authors
proposed a solution to address these challenges based on IIoT
technologies. The proposed framework is celebrated to enhance
lean manufacturing production and reduce excessive
communication among varying departments in the enterprise.
Korchagin et al. [41] used ARENA to simulate the effects of
IIoT technologies on the lean production of the aviation
industry in Russia and China. Based on a Boeing case study, the
authors concluded that the use of IIoT results in the lean
manufacturing of safe and quality aircraft products. The authors
suggested that this application is profitable, and implementable
across countries, and industries. The use of the Industrial
Internet of Things has been associated with the identification of
overproduction, as well as the implementation of JIT which aids
in the reduction of overproduction.
3.3. Waiting and Big Data
“Waiting” waste is the delay time for employees such as
equipment downtime, delay in processing, being out of stock of
materials, or production equipment not ready [30]. Kho et al.
[42] integrated big data analytics solutions to decrease lead time
in the manufacturing process. Within a manufacturing shop
floor, the authors proposed a radio frequency identificationbased solution to track time at each stage of the manufacturing
process. Results indicated that manufacturing time at each
phase of the batch input manufacturing decreased since the big
data solution suggested needed changes in the process. Big data
analytics improves manufacturer’s ability to build to order
systems. Consumers may channel their preferences along the
manufacturing process allowed by intelligent data systems that
integrate consumers’ desires in the manufacturing process of
products [43]. Ye et al. [44] concluded that big data analytics
decreased waiting time in tracking products, their locations, and
features. The authors suggested that manufacturers increase
their supply chain efficiency by relying on intelligent big data
transportation systems. The use and the analysis of big data
capabilities have shown to have an impact on the identification
of waiting wastes and on increasing the operators’ productivity.
3.4. Transportation, Big Data, and SystemsIntegration
Transportation waste is the movement of components and
products between stations that aren’t required to reach
customers’ needs [30]. Big Data applications in transportation
manufacturing sectors carry a wide range of positive benefits
[45]. The authors surveyed 320 manufacturers across industries
and reported positive gains on their supply chain sustainability
performance because of implementing big data analytics.
Specifically, big data analytics helped manufacturers improve
their circular economy practices, and sustainable supply chain
activities, which resulted in efficient lean transportation. Bag
[46] concluded a positive relationship between the
implementation of big data and sustainable supply chain
practice among South African engineering companies. The
author suggested that big data applications improve real-time
knowledge about problematic routes, equipment, vehicles,
personnel, and suppliers making manufacturers correct their
choices to guarantee smooth transportation quickly. Moktadir
et al. [47] demonstrated how big data analytics is an important
element in the establishment of robust transportation systems in
the manufacturing field. The authors reported that once the data
types are known to the manufacturer and a big data tool is
specified, waste in the supply chain phase will be minimized.
Similarly, the use and the analysis of big data capabilities has
shown to have an impact on the identification of transportation
wastes and on increasing the transporters’ productivity. System
integration refers to the increased connectivity and linking of
cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing operation. The
more connected the systems are within an operation, the easier
the detection of waste sources, and customers’ needs, which
aids manufacturers in providing further value to their customers
– which is the core concept of lean [48].On the other hand, the
more diverse systems are, and the more technically advanced
they are, the harder their integration is. Therefore, it is best for
manufacturers to standardize their systems and tools to
guarantee higher degree of integration, which will result in
enhanced continuous flow and improvement at all levels of the
operation [49, 50].
3.5.Overprocessing and Big Data
Overprocessing waste is the addition of unrequired
processes to produce a product or utilizing a more capable
machine when a simpler one would be sufficient for the task at
hand [30]. The application of big data analytics in the
manufacturing process is a promising practice enhancing lean
manufacturing outcomes [51]. Abell et al. [52] applied big data
to manufacturing process control and proposed a new method
to improve quality assurance called process monitoring for
quality. The authors implemented their new proposed

assessment method in the battery industry and found significant
improvements in process streamlining and standardization.Big
data tools could be linked with machines to autonomously
correct any deviations from standardized processes using the
information generated and recommended by the intelligent
data-based systems [33]. Majeed et al. [53] proposed a
framework for integrating big data analytics for optimizing
manufacturing processes. Applying the framework in 3D
printing company, the proposed application resulted in benefits
for products manufacturing. Big data analytics helped
automated machines identify customers’ needs and integrate
them into every phase of the manufacturing process.
3.6.Inventory and Cloud Computing
Inventory waste is all the materials, components, or products
in storage for a longer than necessary [30]. Cloud computing
technologies guarantees better estimates for product and
predicted inventory amounts compared to traditional software
downloads on personalized computers [54]. Cloud computing
increases the cost-effectiveness of inventory handling by
eliminating the need for servers, as well as human-related
services rendered in inventory management on-site. Inventory
amounts could be accessed anytime, anywhere, a nd from any
device with a high degree of accuracy. This saves time spent on
updating computer software and systems used to estimate
inventory, as well as manage it [55]. Most importantly, cloud
computing allows manufacturers to centralize inventory
management activities. All processes relevant to inventory
organization, arrangement, and ordering could be handled in
one location, the cloud, where every stakeholder has access to
the needed information [56].
3.7.Underutilized Skills and Augmented Reality.
Underutilized skills waste is the failure of tapping into
employees’ skills and knowledge to make improvements [30].
Augmented reality tools are increasingly used in the
manufacturing sector to improve workers’ knowledge, skills,
and abilities in lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0
applications [57]. Augmented reality tutorials, programs, and
workshops could be delivered to demotivated individuals who
are not utilizing their skills to achieve lean objectives at the
workplace. Augmented reality could be used to teach managers
how to reward hard work, recognize employees, and stimulate
innovation [58]. Augmented reality could open new horizons
and avenues to the application of technical skills endowed by
manufacturers’ personnel [59]. The technology could be used
in demonstrating additive manufacturing processes or
simulated optimized systems [60]. Moreover, employees could
utilize their existing knowledge to achieve the desired future
states of optimized quality products and processes [61].
3.8. Motion, Simulation, and Additive Manufacturing
Motion waste is the unnecessary human movement, whether
on the shop floor or micro-movement within a workstation [30].
Simulation software applications have been shown to have the
capability of decreasing motion wastes [62]. Lean
manufacturing experts could design optimal workstation
layouts, and physical environments and assess their efficiency
by using simulation software. Simulation software could
eliminate wastes in the production planning phase [63] by the
evaluation of alternative planning strategies to determine the
optimal course of action. Simulations allow the design of
process maps and the test of insertion or deletion of different
phases to generate the most effective and efficient results
desired. Manufacturing simulations allow manufacturers to
integrate siloed operations within the general system by
eliminating excess resources, people, or equipment. Moreover,
simulation platforms allow manufacturers to evaluate the
performance of their process designs [64, 65]. Additive
manufacturing refers to the creation of high-dimensional
objects by the disposition of materials like 3D printing [66].
Additive manufacturing saves large amounts of resources and
minimizes the waste of operator motion, resources, costs, and
energy used in production [67], this helps manufacturers
achieve the objectives of lean manufacturing.
4. Discussion and Conclusions
The literature review has shown how Industry 4.0
capabilities and their different applications have a significant
and growing role in the successful implementation of lean
manufacturing initiatives, as shown in Fig. 1.
The different solutions provided by these capabilities can be
used in the process of identifying andeliminatinglean wastes.
The identification of the lean wastes will have a clear benefit
for SMEs, as they typically operate on small transformational
budgets related to the lean implementation journeys, therefore

having digital capabilities that improve the identification of
waste and will ensure that the transformational budgets are
allocated effectively. This will result in successful lean
journeys that deliver more efficient and productive
manufacturing systems.
It can be concluded that all lean manufacturing wastes can
be identified, as well as eliminated, using various digital tools
that are considered part of Industry 4.0. This research has
shown how IIoT mitigates overproduction across industries,
and how its implementation is associated with a lower process
and product defects. Moreover, the implementation of big data
in manufacturing has been found to have positive effects on
reducing waiting times across the manufacturing process and
delivery, as well as transportation of parts, and the need for
overprocessing. Studies have also shown how instant access to
records stored on the cloud can reduce inventory, and how
augmented reality can be used for upskilling of operators and
in the identification of unutilized skills. Finally, how simulation
and digital modelling has been extensively used in the
identification and reduction of motion. Further research that
builds on this work would seek to understand the relationships
between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing, such as the
associations linking Industry 4.0 capabilities with lean
manufacturing metrics, and how Industry 4.0 can improve the
lean manufacturing tools.
