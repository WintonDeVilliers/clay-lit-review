# Literature Review: Towards Disruptions in Earth Observation? New Earth Observation Systems and

Markets Evolution: Possible Scenarios and Impacts

## Introduction

Earth observation (EO) plays a crucial role in monitoring and understanding various aspects of our planet.
Over the years, new initiatives and advancements in EO systems have emerged, potentially disrupting the
existing EO landscape and impacting markets. This literature review aims to review the trends in EO and
explore the possible scenarios and impacts of new EO systems on the market. The review synthesizes the
provided research findings to gain insights into the evolving field of EO.

## Trends in Earth Observation

The field of EO has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, driven by technological innovations and the availability of high-resolution data. Hansen et al. (2013) conducted a study to create
high-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change. Their research findings highlight the
importance of accurate and up-to-date EO data for monitoring and understanding forest cover changes.
Guanter et al. (2015) discuss the EnMAP spaceborne imaging spectroscopy mission, which offers new
possibilities for Earth observation. They emphasize the potential of spectroscopy in providing valuable
information for monitoring various Earth processes and phenomena.
Li and Roy (2017) conducted a global analysis of Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Landsat-8 data revisit
intervals. Their research findings shed light on the revisit capabilities of these satellites and their implications for terrestrial monitoring. The study emphasizes the importance of frequent revisit intervals for
capturing dynamic land cover changes.

## Impacts on Markets

The advancements in EO systems have the potential to disrupt the existing EO market and create new
opportunities. Mccabe et al. (2017) discuss the future of EO in hydrology. Their research findings highlight
the importance of EO data in understanding and modeling hydrological processes. The study suggests that
advancements in EO can lead to improved water resource management and flood forecasting.

Getzin et al. (2012) explore the use of very high-resolution images and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
for assessing biodiversity in forests. Their research findings demonstrate the potential of high-resolution
EO data and UAVs in monitoring and managing forest ecosystems. The study highlights the market
potential for providing biodiversity assessment services using these technologies.
Daudt et al. (2018) present a study on urban change detection using multispectral EO data and convolutional neural networks. Their research findings suggest that deep learning techniques can improve the
accuracy and efficiency of urban change detection. The study highlights the market potential for automated
urban monitoring services using EO data and deep learning algorithms.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings shed light on the trends and impacts of new EO systems, there are
still knowledge gaps that warrant further research. For example, Singh et al. (2015) discuss the prediction
of spatial and decadal land use and land cover changes using cellular automata Markov chain models and
EO datasets. However, more research is needed to explore the integration of advanced machine learning
techniques with EO data for more accurate and efficient land cover change predictions.
Hoeser and Kuenzer (2020) provide a review of object detection and image segmentation with deep
learning on EO data. However, further research is needed to explore the application of these techniques
in specific domains, such as agriculture, forestry, and urban planning. Understanding the limitations
and challenges of deep learning algorithms in different EO applications will be crucial for future
advancements.
Transon et al. (2018) discuss the hyperspectral EO applications from space in the context of the Sentinel-2
mission. However, future research should focus on the development of advanced hyperspectral sensors
and the integration of hyperspectral data with other EO datasets. This will enable more accurate and
detailed monitoring of various Earth processes and phenomena.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the trends in EO and the emergence of new EO systems have the potential to disrupt the
existing EO landscape and impact markets. The integration of high-resolution data, advanced machine
learning techniques, and innovative sensors opens up new possibilities for monitoring and understanding
our planet. However, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed through further research.
Future studies should focus on addressing these gaps and exploring the potential of new EO systems
in various applications and domains. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of EO for better
