# Literature Review: Cybersecurity in a Post-Data Environment: Considerations on the Regulation of

Code and the Role of Producer and Consumer Liability in Smart Devices

## Introduction

Smart devices have become increasingly popular, crossing the streams of both the physical and virtual
worlds, and offering significant benefits to users and society at large. However, with their growth in
popularity, there is a corresponding increase in risks, not only to users but also to the internet as a whole.
This literature review aims to explore the concept of cybersecurity in a post-data environment, focusing
on the regulation of code and the role of producer and consumer liability in smart devices. The review will
synthesize relevant research findings to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic and identify
knowledge gaps for future research.

## Scope of Threats Posed by Hacking Smart Devices

The hacking of smart devices poses significant threats, both to the users and the internet at large. These
threats can now extend beyond virtual risks and have tangible physical implications. The paper by Nash
(2021) discusses the scope of threats posed by hacking smart devices and highlights the physical nature
of these risks. It emphasizes the need for effective cybersecurity measures to protect users and the internet
from these threats.

## Methodology for Apportioning Liability to Manufacturers

To address the risks associated with smart devices, especially in relation to hacking and cybersecurity, it
becomes crucial to determine liability and responsibility for any damages or breaches. The paper by Nash
(2021) proposes a novel methodology to apportion liability to manufacturers. This methodology can help
distribute responsibility among different stakeholders involved in the production and distribution of smart
devices. By doing so, it aims to ensure that manufacturers are held accountable for any vulnerabilities or
flaws in their products that may lead to cybersecurity breaches.

## Liability Issues in Electronic Transactions and Data Transfer

Liability issues in electronic transactions, particularly in the context of data transfer using various devices
and architectures, are important considerations in the field of cybersecurity. Chun (2019) investigates

these issues and highlights the challenges and consequences of security or privacy breaches in electronic
transactions. The research emphasizes the need for robust security measures to protect sensitive data
during electronic transactions and suggests potential legal frameworks to address liability concerns.

## Product Liability Laws and Application to Manufacturers

Product liability laws play a crucial role in holding manufacturers, retailers, and other parties accountable
for injuries or financial losses caused by defective products. Fairgrieve (2020) explores the concept of
product liability and its application to manufacturers. While the focus of this research is not specifically on
smart devices, the insights can be applied to the context of cybersecurity in smart devices. It emphasizes
the importance of legal frameworks to ensure manufacturers' accountability for any damages or losses
caused by security breaches in their products.

## Regulation of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare raises various legal and ethical concerns, including
issues of liability for medical negligence and privacy breaches. Donnelly (2022) explores the challenges
and legal frameworks for regulating the use of AI in healthcare, shedding light on the potential implications for cybersecurity in smart medical devices. The research emphasizes the need for comprehensive
regulations to address liability concerns and protect patient privacy and security.

## Challenges and Legal Frameworks for Internet of Things (IoT) Devices

Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices present unique challenges in terms of privacy, safety, and data
breaches. Tschider (2018) discusses the potential risks and challenges associated with IoT devices and
emphasizes the need for comprehensive legal frameworks to address these issues. While the research does
not specifically focus on smart devices, the insights can be applied to understand the broader cybersecurity
concerns in smart devices and the importance of regulatory measures.

## Liability Scenarios Following Cyber Attacks on Chemical Facilities

The potential liability scenarios following a cyber attack on a chemical facility are explored in the research
by Tschider (2018). While the focus of this research is not on smart devices, it highlights the importance of
addressing liability concerns in the context of cybersecurity. The application of the Support Anti-Terrorism
By Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act is discussed as a potential mitigation strategy to
allocate liability and reduce the impact of cyber attacks. These insights can be relevant to understanding
liability issues in the context of smart devices and their vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.

## Privacy and Security in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) raises significant concerns regarding patient privacy and security.
Lindenfeld (2016) addresses the legal and regulatory gaps in protecting patients' privacy and security in the
IoMT. The research proposes an interim liability framework to hold software manufacturers accountable
for inadequate security measures. While the focus is on the IoMT, the insights can be applied to the broader
context of smart devices and their cybersecurity implications.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings offer valuable insights into the regulation of code and the role of
producer and consumer liability in smart devices' cybersecurity, there are several knowledge gaps that
warrant further research:

1. **Evaluation of Existing Legal Frameworks**: Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of existing legal frameworks in addressing cybersecurity concerns in smart devices. This
   evaluation can help identify gaps and propose improvements to ensure adequate protection for users.
2. **Impact of Emerging Technologies**: With the rapid advancement of technology, it is crucial to
   assess the impact of emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, on
   the cybersecurity of smart devices. Future research should explore potential vulnerabilities and develop
   strategies to mitigate risks.
3. **International Cooperation and Standards**: As cybersecurity is a global issue, future research
   should examine the importance of international cooperation in developing standardized regulations and
   cybersecurity standards for smart devices. This research can provide insights into the challenges and
   opportunities of global collaboration in addressing cybersecurity threats.
4. **User Awareness and Education**: User awareness and education play a critical role in ensuring the
   security of smart devices. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of user awareness
   programs and educational initiatives in promoting safe practices and reducing cybersecurity risks.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: The ethical implications of cybersecurity in smart devices deserve further
   exploration. Future research should examine the ethical considerations associated with the regulation of
   code, liability allocation, and user privacy in the context of smart devices.

   By addressing these knowledge gaps and pursuing future research in these areas, policymakers, manufacturers, and users can work together to enhance the cybersecurity of smart devices and protect against
   potential risks and vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The literature review provides a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity in a post-data environment, with a specific focus on the regulation of code and the role of producer and consumer liability
in smart devices. Through the integration and synthesis of the provided research findings, the review
highlights the scope of threats posed by hacking smart devices, proposes a methodology for apportioning
liability to manufacturers, and explores relevant insights from related fields such as electronic transactions,
product liability laws, AI in healthcare, IoT devices, and the IoMT. The review also identifies knowledge
gaps and suggests potential future research directions to further enhance the understanding and regulation
of cybersecurity in smart devices.
