abstract
Artificial Intelligence and Smart Contracts are two cutting-edge technological achievements of the so-called 4th Industrial Revolution era. Both have already had a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, including transactions, and each one has already been under scientific investigation. Instead, their interaction has not become the subject of a debate, al- though it can further (positively) affect the transactions. This interconnection takes place through specific mechanisms, called Oracles, which can be, among others, highly sophis- ticated Artificial Intelligence systems (autonomous systems). The present article aims to present the role of the Artificial Intelligence Oracles throughout the ‘smart contractual pro- cedure’, as well as to shed light on the potential (new) legal issues this interconnection may raise. The main result of this article is to indicate the appropriate legal directions in case of Artificial Intelligence Oracles’ failures, based on the most prevalent current approaches to AI’s (the user’s) contractual and/or non-contractual liability. The major research’s con- clusion is that the Artificial Intelligence Oracle’s failures may result in one of the following situations: (a) breach of a (smart) contract, (b) unjust enrichment, (c) conclusion of a (void- able) smart contract that should not have been concluded, or (d) non-conclusion of a smart contract that should have been concluded. The responsibility of each person participating in the ‘smart contractual procedure’, i.e. the contractual parties, the blockchain platform and the Artificial Intelligence user/owner (or even the Artificial Intelligence system itself), as well as the AI provider or designer, is examined in each of the afore-mentioned situations separately. Given that legislative initiatives have already begun, the present article aspires to contribute to the consistent address of the newly raised legal issues.

  1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (henceforth AI)1 and Smart Con- tracts (henceforth SmC)2 are two cutting-edge technological achievements of the 4th Industrial Revolution era.3 They both have a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, from daily activities (e.g., transportation and entertainment) to the job market, banking, finance, the medical sector, and transactions.
A lot has been written in recent decades regarding each of these breakthroughs and their impact from a legal perspec- tive. However, the ‘cooperation’ of these novel technologies has not become the subject of debate yet, although their in- teraction has already become apparent.4 Indeed, the use of AI applications on blockchain technology, and particularly on SmC, has proven to be a useful tool for bringing into touch the on-chain world, i.e., a SmC running on a blockchain platform, with the off-chain one, i.e. the ‘real’ world where the contrac- tual outcomes occur. Such an interaction can further bene- fit transactions, enhancing their velocity, decreasing costs as well as the possibility of contractual non-performance, either by default or without default.
Nonetheless, this interconnection poses some legal issues that have never been raised before. For instance, in the event of a malfunction attributed to an AI system that affects the operation of a SmC it is questionable as to whether the user- contractual party on-chain should be held liable and as to what rights they have, in comparison with a party in a ‘tra- ditional’ contract concluded and executed entirely off-chain, if they can be released from their liability, etc. However, there is no specific legal framework regulating the interaction be- tween AI and SmC, which poses a challenge for legal doctrine. The main points of interest are the fitness of classical legal doctrine and, especially, contract law, to successfully regulate the new transaction reality created by these technologies and the systemization of any new legislative enactment thereon.5

This paper aims to present the interconnection between AI and SmC, shed light on the potential legal issues this inter- connection may raise, and suggest certain legal directions to be addressed.
The paper consists of four parts: the first two parts seek to introduce the reader to the concept of AI and SmC accordingly, as well as to describe their role at modern transactions (2, 3). Of course, all technical aspects cannot be presented in this ar- ticle. Apart from being extensively discussed in literature al- ready, they are not necessary for understanding the legal con- cerns this interaction induces. For this reason, the article puts emphasis only on those technicalities which are significant from a legal point of view. In this framework, the paper also examines the legal treatment of AI, as well as of SmC. As far as AI is concerned, the analysis is restricted to the autonomous AI systems (or autonomous machines) for two reasons: first, be- cause they constitute the most representative type of AI sys- tems nowadays, with an extended usage in almost all sectors of modern life, including transactions; second, because they show great levels of autonomy that cast doubts on the appro- priateness of the ‘traditional’ rules of law about human liabil- ity in the event of damage caused by autonomous AI systems. In the paper, the prevalent opinion about AI users’ contrac- tual (and non-contractual) liability is adopted, enhanced with further arguments. Respectively, the paper examines the var- ious types of SmC and their legal nature, which is particularly important to understand in order to formulate the liability is- sues raised in case of damage caused by the interconnection between SmC and AI.
The next part presents the oracles: the mechanisms which facilitate the interconnection between the SmC and the off- chain world (4). Although there are several types of ora- cles, the paper focuses on the autonomous AI oracles since they are the oracles that can enable an autonomous interac- tion with the SmC, revolutionizing the way people carry out transactions.
In the fourth part, the various types of AI oracle failures, as well as their impact on SmC, are analyzed (5). This impact may vary depending on the underlying kind of SmC and can raise, inter allia, one of the following situations: (a) breach of a (smart) contract, (b) unjust enrichment, (c) conclusion of a (voidable) SmC that should not have been concluded, or (d) non-conclusion of a SmC that should have been con- cluded. Further, the analysis shows that all the persons tak- ing part in the ‘smart contractual procedure’, i.e., the con- tractual parties, the blockchain platform, the AI user/owner, as well as the AI provider or designer, may be held liable based on different liability regimes (i.e. contractual, non- contractual liability regimes) in each of the afore-mentioned
situations.
In the last part the main conclusions regarding the inter-
connection of the two novel technologies from a legal point of view are presented (6).

  2. The role of artificial intelligence in modern transactions: applications, limitations and legal treatment
2.1. Applications of AI and inherent limitations
Over the past decades, AI has become a scientific field of pri- mary importance on a global scale.6 Since its official7 estab- lishment in 1956 at the Dartmouth College Conference,8 until today,9 its technological breakthroughs have significantly af- fected various areas of modern life,10 even though sometimes this has remained unnoticed.11
The most typical representatives of AI systems today are deemed to be the so-called autonomous AI systems or autonomous machines, whose performance is exceptional in diverse fields,12 thanks to their ability to learn. This abil-
6 Although the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is widely accepted, the scientific community does not fully agree about its specific con- tent, see Rissland, “Artificial Intelligence and Law: Stepping Stones to a Model of Legal Reasoning” (1990) Yale L Rev 1957; Ertel, Intro- duction to Artificial Intelligence (2nd edn., Springer 2017); UNESCO, Preliminary Study on the Ethics of AI (2019) <https://unesdoc. unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367823> accessed 20 Dec 2022 (pp. 7-9); Müller, "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2021) Zalta (ed.), <https://plato. stanford.edu/archives/sum2021/entries/ethics- ai/> accessed 20 Dec 2022.
7 Nonetheless, the first thoughts about AI had already been ex- pressed in 1950 by Alan Turing in his article “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950) 59 Minds and Machines 433, where the fa- mous ‘imitation game’ was first introduced.

ity, called machine learning,13 enables the AI system to im- prove itself at the execution of any assigned task by gain- ing its own experience and knowledge14 through the pro- cessing of vast amounts of data (‘Big Data’).15 Thanks to this ability autonomous AI systems can have a sig- nificant impact on transactions,16 where they are proven to be able to fully replace humans in a contractual procedure.17
The application of the autonomous AI systems brings sig- nificant advantages for transactions, since they significantly reduce the time needed for negotiations.18,19 Nonetheless,

Nonetheless, it is also supported that AI increases the (transactional) costs because the costs asso- ciated with AI are huge (e.g. cost of hardware, cost of data, cost for trianing models, cost deployment auomation, security costs, continuous optimization costs), see Mhlanga, „Industry 4.0 in Financne: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Digital Financial Inclusion“ (2020 8 Inter J Financial Studies; Birdzell, „How to Decrease the Cost of AI“, availabe at <https: //ask.kristasoft.com/webinar- cost- of- ai> accessed 9 Jul 2023.

 machine learning renders their function opaque, which al- though exceptional, is inexplicable for humans, even for their designers. This constitutes the so-called black box effect or black box problem, from which all autonomous systems suffer.20 This is an inherent limitation of the AI systems that can negatively affect their rendered outcomes,21 jeopardizing AI sustainabil- ity22 and its further public acceptance. Further, it sparks a hot debate in the literature about the appropriate legal treat- ment of autonomous AI systems, as analyzed immediately below.
2.2. Legal treatment
Despite the extensive use of autonomous machines in trans- actions, there is no consensus in literature with regard to their legal treatment in the case of contractual23 (as well as in the case of non-contractual) liability.

According to the most prevalent opinion,24 the law as it now stands should consider autonomous machines as mere communication tools, like any other software system (e.g., email) or electronic devices (e.g., telephones and fax machines), or like a messenger (nuntius),25 whose role is merely to convey the declaration of intention (offer or acceptance) of its user- principal to the other contractual party, and/or like an agent, who performs the contractual obligations on behalf of the principal. Although AI systems show greater levels of auton- omy, this approach adopts a legal fiction that anything issued by an autonomous AI system is actually issued by its user,26 given that the system lacks the necessary legal and contrac- tual capacity for being itself legally bound by the contract and civil liability.27
Highlighting the trait of autonomy, other opinions suggest that autonomous machines should be legally treated as rep- resentatives under the mutatis mutandis application of the law of disclosed agency;28 or that they should be attributed a legal personhood, in order to acquire legal and, thus, contractual ca- pacity, like legal persons;29 or that they should be considered as contemporary electronic “slaves”30 that will not bear full legal capacity but will have a restricted capacity of contracting, like the Ancient Roman slaves,31 and a civil insurance in case they cause any damage; or that they should be electronic persons or hybrid-electronic persons,32 which is a business registry for up- to-date certificated autonomous machines33 that will be civil insured and possess a bare minimum of property deposited by their owners,34 whose liability in the case of damage is limited accordingly.

The basic advantage of these approaches is that they take into account that AI systems act autonomously.35 Nevertheless, they fail, in fact, to provide practical solutions, while they “ex- ceed” the current legal framework: the current rules of pri- vate law have not (yet) attributed legal personhood to the autonomous AI systems,36 while it cannot be held that they could have contractual capacity, even a restricted one, with- out legal capacity. Besides, in practice, no registry about AI systems has been established yet,37 while the existence of a “legal representative” who bears no property does not facili- tate in any way the third party-claimants.
Therefore, the prevalent opinion, according to which the autonomous machines should be treated as communication tools and any contractual liability arising from their use should be attributable directly to their users, seems to be the most consistent one within the current legal framework. Fur- ther, this approach boosts the transaction security, since it clar- ifies the person who should be responsible in the case of non- performance: the AI user. It also provides the latter with a strong incentive to ensure that their “employed” autonomous machine operates properly. Indeed, had the AI user not been considered legally bound regarding the contract concluded by their “employed” autonomous machine, they would not have been cautious enough about their AI system’s proper func- tion.38 Moreover, any AI user could rely on the system’s al- leged malfunction or opaque function (the aforementioned AI black box problem or black box effect) to avoid their engagement in the contract; as a result, the other contractual party would bear the risk of the AI system’s (mal)function, without having any power over it and, most of the time, without even know- ing that they transact with an autonomous machine and not with a human.
This is a typical situation of information asymmetry between
the contractual parties of a contract, where one of them has an
incentive to increase their exposure to risk because their con-
fect. The prevalent opinion "protects" the counter contractual party from this risk, providing at the same time a certain ele- ment of justice: since the AI user is the one who opts to employ an autonomous machine and to involve it in trading, the as- sumption that they should bear the cost of any (mal)function of it sounds logical.40
Given that in common law systems the contractual liability is non-fault based, while in the civil law ones the relevant fault is being presumed, this approach is also quite aligned with the prevalent opinion about the AI user’s non-contractual liabil- ity, which endorses that the negligence-based liability regime, like the tort liability, should be put aside, and a strict liability regime be adopted.41 It is claimed that until then,42 the rules of law about vicarious liability,43 or about the parents’ or animal keeper’s ones,44 should be implemented mutatis mutandis since they are more suitable for handling any damages caused by autonomous AI systems.
The above analysis is crucial for handling damages raised in the case of SmC, when they cannot be self-concluded, self- performed and/or self-executed due to an AI oracle’s failure, as it is analyzed thoroughly below.

 a series of papers,45 in which he presented a concept of con- tracts that can be self-performed and self-executed without, or with little, human intervention. According to Szabo, SmC are the technological evolution of classic vending machines46 that facilitate automated contract performance and contract execution, significantly decreasing transactional costs and en- hancing transactions’ velocity.
Szasbo’s revolutionary concept did not become a reality until over 10 years later. Although some progress had been made in this direction,47 for many years the concept of SmC remained unknown in the trade industry. It was the devel- opment of blockchain technology in 2000 that enabled SmC to
45 According to Szabo’s ‘definition’, smart contracts are “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises. The protocols are usually im- plemented with programs on a computer network, or in other forms of digital electronics”. Thus, they can “formalize and secure digital relationships” more efficiently “than their inanimate paper-based ancestors”, “Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Net- works” (1997) First Monday; “Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets” (1996) <http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/ InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/ szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html> accessed 30 Dec 2022; “Smart Contracts” (1994) <http://www.fon.hum. uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/ LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html> accessed 30 Dec 2022.

47 Indeed, insurance companies offer passengers the possibility to purchase flight insurance from a ‘vending machine’ stationed in airports, usually at flight gates. To do this, the customer in- puts their personal data and flight information on the machine’s screen and makes payment, by inserting coins in the slot or us- ing another form of payment. When the predefined conditions are met (provision of personal data, flight data, and payment), the machine issues an insurance policy and retains a duplicate for the company’s records; see Cannarsa, “Interpretation of Con- tracts and Smart Contracts: Smart Interpretation or Interpretation of Smart Contracts?” (2018) 26 Eur Rev of Private L 773 (p. 784); Rohr, “Smart Contracts and Traditional Contract Law, Or: The Law of the Vending Machine” (2019) 67 Cleveland State L Rev 71 (p. 82).

thrive.48 Although this technology49 was first introduced as a technological backbone for cryptocurrencies, especially Bit- coin,50 it was soon found to also be able to facilitate other ap- plications as a communication path for trusted transactions that can securely convey and store data.51 Among those, the most significant one is smart contracts.52 The most widespread blockchain platform for SmC is the public blockchain platform Ethereum.53 Established in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum blockchain infrastructure allows anyone who has access to the decentralized network to exchange any virtual asset (digital or digitally represented) with the use of a cryptocurrency called Ether.54
The advent of SmC brings about several significant changes for transactions, most of which are due to the distributed ledger technology on which they are based (automatic perfor- mance of contractual obligations;55 no - or at least restricted possibilities for - breach of contract;56 trust between con-

58 Nonetheless, this does not mean that they are more econom- ical in comparison to traditional contracts since the necessary technological equipment is quite expensive, while the electricity consumption, especially for solving the problem and verifying the transaction, is high (see Savelyev (2016), p. 127; Temte (2019), p. 92), while the drafting of a smart contract is not easy for a person, who must resort to a special engineer (see Lingwall & Mogallapu (2019), p. 314 ff.; Temte (2019), p. 97; Pardolesi & Davola (2019), pp. 8-9; Müller & Seiler (2019), pp. 320-321; Junghöfer (2021), p. 8).

ment,66 clearing process67 or issuing of letters of credit);68 in logistics and supply chains;69 even in the law profession for contract drafting.70 However, the sectors where they have had the most valuable use up to now are the private insur- ance industry and crowdfunding projects.71 In these cases, a SmC usually facilitates the verification of certain events and the allocation of funds to claimers/beneficiaries in a direct and quick way: an insurance company creates a policy in the form of a SmC, which applies when specific conditions are met, e.g. when a natural disaster occurs (like a hurricane, earth- quake or drought); once the relative data (e.g. wind speed, lo- cation, magnitude of earthquake) are inserted into the sys- tem, the compensation can automatically be released to the claimers.7273 Accordingly, as an example, in a crowdfunding project,74 once the amount exceeds the necessary total, it is automatically transferred to the beneficiary.75
Apart from these two last cases, SmC can have an extended use in other transactions, facilitating contract performance and execution.76 For instance, in the stock market they can be used for stock purchase and stock sales, when prices reach a certain level.77 Moreover, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), SmC are expected to gain even more impor- tance, allocating obligations, duties and rights to connected devices.78 Their role should not necessarily be limited only to quite rudimentary transactions, such as cryptocurrency trans- fer from A’s wallet to B’s when specific conditions occur,79 or

 imposing penalties when the set conditions are not met. Since an economic asset (movable, immovable or data/information) can be digitally represented and controlled by digital means,80 it can be the subject of a SmC.81 Instead when contract per- formance requires effort or expertise, as in service contracts (e.g., in teaching and caring),82 the contractual object cannot be digitally represented and, thus, it cannot be supported by a SmC. Similarly, transactions which entail non-operational clauses, such as legal concepts of ‘good faith’, ‘undertake best endeavors in’, or ‘reasonable standard’, which demand quali- tative judgment, cannot be part of a SmC.83
Further, SmC are inflexible,84 i.e., unmodifiable in case the circumstances or the legal landscape change: once put in mo- tion, they are executed according to their predefined smart code, and no one can inhibit or influence the expected and fully foreseeable transactional outcome. This rigid85 character may sometimes contradict good faith and business practices or even legislation that demands more flexibility in transac- tions. For instance, in the event of an unexpected strike or bad weather conditions that affect transportation, any delay in product delivery or money deposit may be justifiable; or in case the legislation changes (e.g., high interest rates), the amount of money that must be deposited may vary. How- ever, the SmC will be executed anyway, according to its prede- fined instructions, although contractual parties may act dif- ferently off-chain, e.g., accepting delayed performance,86 or a partial one. This constitutes another inherent limitation of SmC which can be overcome only if they have direct interac- tion with the off-chain world. Such an interaction can be real- ized through specific mechanisms, called oracles. Should they be AI systems, particularly autonomous ones, the potential of SmC will be unleashed, given the endless capabilities these AI systems have,87 as analyzed thoroughly below (see under 4).
3.2. Legal treatment
The legal nature of SmC has been the subject of an extended debate.88 On the one hand, a great part of legal scholars claims

that SmC do not constitute any legal contract, but rather they are mere computer protocols that execute an already con- cluded contract. On the other hand, others accept their legally binding character, claiming that they are able even to fully re- place traditional legal contracts. In fact, both approaches seem to be incomplete, insofar as they highlight only some of SmC’s features (the technical or the legal ones, respectively) belittling others (the legal or the technical ones, respectively). Thus, they only partially capture their dynamic concept, which in fact can have different forms in transactions.
Indeed, a SmC can appear in transactions in one of the following forms:89 (a) as a tool for self-performance and self- execution of an already concluded contract; (b) as a specific part of a contract (hybrid contract),90 with a typical example the Ricardian contracts;91 and (c) as a stand-alone SmC. More specifically for each of these types:
(a) The first type of SmC is the most common one in prac- tice so far. With this type, the contractual parties have already communicated in the real (off-chain) world,92 negotiated the contractual terms, and concluded the contract entirely off-chain, orally or in prose, if required. After having concluded and formed the contract, they choose to encode (part of) the contractual content in the blockchain platform93 to take advantage of the ben- efits this technology entails, i.e. the automatic contract’s self-performance and self-execution.94 To that end, the contract must be expressed in a programming language, namely be ‘translated’ from a natural language to a computer programming one95 (e.g. to Solidity or to an- other computer language based on Boolean logic), and, subsequently, be embedded in the blockchain platform (smart code). The contractual content translated and em- bedded into the blockchain platform constitutes the so- called contractware.96 The contractware is not a contract from a legal point of view;97 it is rather a computer pro- gram that serves as a technical tool for facilitating the

96 Contractware is called the procedure of ‘translation’ and imple- mentation of the contractual terms in the blockchain platform, see Raskin (2017), p. 307, 312.
97 See also Meyer (2020), p. 19 arguing that smart contracts are ‘apps’ that both reflect the parties’ agreement, like the contract document, and initiate its performance. For these reasons, smart contracts cannot be held void or be terminated, unlike legal con-
  
automatic self-performance and self-execution of an al- ready off-chain concluded and formed contract.98 For this reason, the contractware does not have any legal binding character, i.e. it does not pose itself any legal obligations to the contractual parties. Instead, it is the off-chain contract that poses them and deals with all the pertinent legal issues.99
(b) In the second type of SmC, the hybrid contract, the con- tractual parties have also communicated in the real off- chain world and negotiated the contractual terms. But they have decided to form the contract partially off- chain and partially on-chain, i.e., a part of the contract is formed in the real world in a natural language, orally or in prose, while the rest part of the contract is directly embedded in the smart code.100 These two parts com- plement one another101 and altogether constitute the one and only contractual content. A typical represen- tative of a hybrid contract would be the Rircardian Con- tracts.102 Their main feature is that they are readable by a human and a computer program at the same time, as they are written in both a natural and a computer lan- guage.103 From a practical point of view, a Ricardian con- tract is a digital document that, after applying special software, automatically converts the natural language, in which it is written by the parties, into a computer lan- guage; any change made to the contractual text in nat- ural language is automatically "reflected" in the com- puter code.
The hybrid SmC serves not only as a means for the con- tract’s self-performance and self-execution, like the previous type, but also as a means for the contract’s for- mation, while its conclusion is conducted entirely off- chain.
(c) The third type of SmC, the stand-alone one, exists entirely on-chain.104,105 This type is the most uncommon so far, but in fact it constitutes the most revolutionary type of SmC since it can alter for good the way people are used

to transacting. The parties usually select this type ei- ther because they cannot, or it is difficult to, have any communication in the real off-chain world (e.g. because they live in different countries), or because they do not want to have any. This way they are able to capture their entire contractual agreement in the blockchain plat- form, from its beginning until its execution. Indeed, con- trary to the previous types of SmC, the stand-alone SmC is concluded entirely on-chain through the blockchain platform with the use of the smart contract code as the contractual language.106 Usually there are no prior ne- gotiations between the contractual parties in the real off-chain world,107 neither any legal document entail- ing the parties’ declarations of intention. Therefore, in the stand-alone SmC the contractual parties use the smart code not only to automatically perform their le- gal obligations, but also to form their declarations of in- tention and communicate them with each other via the blockchain platform;108 i.e. the blockchain serves not only as a tool for the contract’s self-performance, self- execution, and formation, but also as a means for the contract’s conclusion,109 facilitating the exchange of the parties’ declarations of intention and the meeting of their minds.
As a result, given that the contractual elements of a con- tract exist, i.e. the parties’ declarations of intentions (of- fer and acceptance), the meeting of their minds (on certain definite contractual terms), their intentions to create legal relations as well as the consideration in the com- mon law jurisdictions, or, respectively, a valid causa in the civil law ones, the stand-alone SmC constitutes a legal contract under the ‘traditional’ rules of contract law.110 Therefore, it is the one which poses the legal obligations to the parties and is subject to (all) rules of law about contracts (e.g. invalidity).111 Its legally binding character is also supported by the principle of the free- dom of contract112 and the principle of informality of con- tracts as well.113 According to the first one, everyone is free to decide whether to enter a contract, to select the face of their contractual party, and to form the contrac- tual content, under the condition that the law and the morality (bonos mores) are not violated, while accord- ing to the second one, no formality is required for the conclusion of a contract, unless otherwise it is provided by law. Specific manifestation thereof is the freedom of the contractual parties to choose the contractual lan- guage in which they want to form the contractual con- tent; this language can be a spoken one (e.g., English,

 German, French, etc.) or a written one (e.g., Latin or Ancient Greek). Accordingly, manifestation of the pri- vate autonomy should be: first, the selection of a (high- level) programming language like Solidity (used by the public blockchain platform Ethereum)114 as the contrac- tual language, as far as there are no special provisions- restrictions regarding the comprehensibility of the lan- guage by the contractual parties;115 second, the use of the blockchain platform by the contractual parties, as an electronic channel to communicate their declarations of intention to each other (like a fax or an email).
Each of these types of SmC may interconnect with AI sys- tems through specific mechanisms called oracles, as they are analyzed immediately below.
4. Oracles
4.1. Introduction
An116 Oracle is any mechanism that extracts data, information or expert knowledge from external sources and provides them to a ‘closed’ system, i.e. a system that has no access to these sources on its own; or vice versa, any mechanism that conveys data from a closed system to the external ‘world’.117 In the case of SmC, oracles serve as a communication channel link- ing the physical (off-chain) world to blockchain infrastructure (on-chain), thus, mitigating the rigid character of SmC and al- lowing them to become more flexible and dynamic.
Oracles can provide a blockchain platform with any infor- mation about outcomes of events (such as elections or sports), financial data (such as exchange rates or stock prices), or sup- ply chain information (such as temperature, location, and de- livery), and vice versa. For instance, in the case of private in- surance provided through SmC, according to which compen- sation must be given to beneficiaries (e.g. farmers) when bad weather conditions occur (such as a hurricane or extended drought), an oracle can provide the blockchain platform with information about the speed of the wind or the total amount of water.118 Furthermore, in the case of a ‘smart lock’, when

115 Such a restriction is provided, for instance, in the case of business to consumer relationships where the contractual lan- guage should be deemed natural, plain and intelligible by the con- sumers, otherwise the contract is considered not concluded (Di- rective 93/13 Art. 5), see Bilski (2019), p. 54, 72.

the predefined fee is received, the oracle can transmit the in- formation off-chain, so that the door can automatically open. There are a lot of types of oracles. One of the most prevalent ones is software oracles.119 These oracles can interact with any sources of information available online, such as databases, servers, and websites, and convey data to the blockchain plat- form in real time. For instance, a software oracle can transmit information regarding stock prices to the blockchain platform,
so that the SmC can buy or sell them.
On the other hand, there are also hardware oracles.120 These
ones interact with the physical world and convey the neces- sary information to the blockchain platform, or vice versa. A hardware oracle is usually installed in physical objects with electronic sensors, like robots, or relates to objects with QR codes/barcodes. Upon receiving the necessary information, a hardware oracle ‘transforms’ it to digital value that can be ‘un- derstood’ by SmC and releases it to the blockchain platform. For instance, upon receiving the information that a transport- ing product has arrived at a loading day, a hardware oracle relays the information to the blockchain platform which then executes decisions based on this information. These oracles have great usage in the supply chain sector.
Both software and hardware oracles can convey informa- tion from external sources to the SmC, and vice versa. The ones that transmit data/information/knowledge from exter- nal sources to the blockchain platform are called inbound ora- cles, while the ones which send them from the blockchain plat- form to the physical world are called outbound oracles. An ex- ample of an inbound oracle is one that informs the blockchain platform about the external temperature; this oracle can be either software (receiving the relevant information from the web), or hardware (receiving it by use of sensors). On the other hand, an example of an outbound oracle is a smart lock: when the necessary funds are deposited to a specified ac- count, the oracle then transmits the information to the physi- cal world and allows a mechanism to unlock the smart lock; or, vice versa, should the agreed funds not be deposited on time, the outbound oracle conveys the information to the physical world and activates the mechanism for inhibiting or interrupt- ing, for example, a vehicle’s function.
Further, there are also oracles which can be used not only for transmitting information from the off-chain world to the on-chain one or vice versa (also known as data carried or auto- mated oracles),121 but ones that can perform computation off- chain and subsequently transmit the outcome on-chain (com- putation oracles).122 For example, a computation oracle can per- form a computationally intensive regression calculation off- chain and release this information to the blockchain technol- ogy; or assess the creditworthiness of a loan-applicant and release the information to the blockchain platform. These or-
elers experiencing delays or airline cancellations. Once the infor- mation about a flight delay or cancelation is acquired, it is au- tomatically provided to the blockchain and compensation is au- tomatically paid to the claimers, see Kipker et al. (2020), p. 510; Stazi (2021), p. 81, footn. 62.
119 Also known as deterministic oracles, see Beniiche (2020) p. 5. 120 Beniiche (2020), p. 2; Poblet et al. (2020), p. 5.

acles are quite useful because SmC demand high computa- tional power to be executed and their costs are high.
Since oracles can directly affect SmC operation, only a trusted third party (known as TTP or TP) should be an ora- cle.123 Such third trusted parties can be humans or legal en- tities or other systems.124 For instance, an oracle can be a courier or an agent125 who certifies to their tablet that a prod- uct has been delivered;126 or a bank which certifies the con- formity of products prior to releasing any amount of money to the beneficiary in the case of a letter of credit; or a system installed in a car, which can send signals to the police, when the car is involved in a car accident.127 Such a system can use AI, i.e. it can be an autonomous AI system. In this case the oracle does not only serve as a ‘bridge’ between the on-chain and the off-chain world,128 but also as a medium for bringing into contact two novel technologies, AI and blockchain, thus, maximizing their potentials.
4.2. AI oracles’ applications on SmC and inherent limitations
AI oracles can have a lot of uses throughout the SmC proce- dure, from its formation and conclusion to its modification. First, as already implied, AI oracles can be used for triggering (smart) contractual conditions in the form of “if X occurs, then Y is executed”.129 All the above-described paradigms, e.g., in- formation about temperature and weather conditions, money deposits, prices’ height, inflation, and exchange rates, are of this type.
But apart from this (expected) use, AI oracles can have more sophisticated applications,130 such as at the formation of (smart) contractual content.131 Production of speech con- stitutes a common subject matter of AI,132 particularly of au- tonomous AI systems. When contractual parties have already entered negotiations off-chain, AI oracles can facilitate the formation of SmC by ‘translating’ natural language to a com- puter language (e.g. Solidity,), and vice versa.133 Of course, this can take place so far only for simple orders, not for sophis- ticated ones, like those including abstract legal notions (e.g.

good faith) or demanding cognitive judgment (e.g. reason- able efforts). Nonetheless, AI systems are showing significant progress in the fields of legal ontology and legal interpreta- tion,134 thus, more legally sophisticated AI applications are ex- pected to develop soon.
Further, AI oracles can be used for controlling proper con- tract performance, identifying the cause of non-performance and whether it is attributable to the debtor.135 For instance, should a product not be delivered on time, an AI oracle can ex- amine the reason for the delay and identify if it is attributable to the debtor’s default or to force majeure (e.g. bad weather conditions or a pandemic that results in disruption and de- lays), releasing the information to the blockchain platform; in the first case, the information will trigger the predefined penalties (already implemented in smart code) against the debtor, while in the second case the system will refrain from it. Determining the cause of non-performance demands some- times sophisticated legal analysis, but since scientific research shows significant progress in this field,136 AI oracles are ex- pected to soon be able to perform well at legal reasoning and argumentation.137
Accordingly, an AI oracle can mitigate the rigid charac- ter of SmC, allowing them to be modified138 when needed. For instance, in the event of an unpredictable change of cir- cumstances or force majeure that demands SmC be modified, the AI oracle can release the information to the blockchain platform, thus, enabling SmC modification prior to being ex- ecuted.139 Moreover, AI oracles can facilitate the procedure of the undoing of SmC. For instance, in the case of an already executed transaction through SmC that needs to be voided, AI oracles can provide the blockchain platform with information about the judicial process’s outcome, in order the transaction to be reserved on-chain. Similarly, AI dispute resolution mech- anisms, which are able to apply their existing encoded legal

 rules,140 can be installed in SmC, providing judgment when a dispute arises.141
However, the role of AI oracles is going to become even more constructive, should they be used at the stage of the conclusion of the SmC. For instance, AI oracles could be used for identifying the age of contractual parties using biometric data142 prior to the conclusion of the SmC; or, similarly, for checking the contractual content for any illegality or immoral- ity, especially the standard unfair contract terms which are typical in transactions (e.g., typical terms in consumer con- tracts, according to EU Directive 93/13/EEC).143 This way, the possibility of a void SmC being incorrectly concluded will be significantly reduced.
Further, as already mentioned above, autonomous AI sys- tems can dynamically interfere with a contractual procedure, fully replacing human agents, i.e., they can select whether or not to enter a contract, choose the face of the other contractual party and define the contractual content.144 In a blockchain environment, AI systems can replace human agents both in posting the SmC onto the platform and accepting it. More specifically, when a user wants a SmC to be concluded and executed, they must render it available on the blockchain plat- form; namely they must implement it in the smart code using a programming language and ‘post’ the identification number of the SmC on the blockchain platform. Subsequently, another user of the platform ‘accepts’ the contract by communicating their acceptance to the other contractual party by paying a cer- tain amount of money and combining the payment with SmC identification number.145 These actions (post and acceptance) could be done autonomously (not just automatically) by ora- cles using AI.146 For instance, AI systems can conclude a sale contract on-chain after assessing and comparing counterpar- ties’ offers and reliability; or sell/purchase stocks on-chain af- ter comparing the profitability of various choices; or, similarly, conclude loan contracts on-chain after estimating the credit- worthiness of loan applicants.147
This use of AI oracles is expected to be the most revolution- ary one since it introduces a new reality for transactions: the ‘real’ smart contract procedure. This is the contractual proce- dure carried out by blockchain platforms interacting with AI systems, where a contract’s formation/conclusion is going to

be autonomous and its performance/execution (at least) au- tomatic, on behalf of its user(s).
Nonetheless, despite the positive influence AI oracles can have on SmC, they may also decelerate their operation,148 while the unknown and maybe inaccurate source of their data/information/knowledge may negatively affect the pro- duced outcome, and the whole procedure as well. Indeed, there is always the possibility an oracle, particularly a soft- ware type, could convey false or inaccurate data/information. Although this is a common problem of all oracles (also referred to, in literature, as the oracle problem),149 the situation becomes even more difficult for AI oracles due to the inherent opacity they suffer from, i.e., their black box.150
A typically proposed solution to the oracle problem are the so-called consensus oracles.151 This is a decentralized network of oracles, which work collectively for the same purpose: be- fore any data is uploaded to the blockchain platform, each or- acle renders its outcomes. After considering the outcomes of most of them, or an average amount, the system releases it to the blockchain.152 Such a type of oracle could be useful, e.g., as a rating system within a prediction market.153
Nonetheless, the potential of oracle malfunction remains, leading to systematic risks for SmC. For this reason, legal doc- trine is called upon to decide what the appropriate legal treat- ment is, in case the AI oracle negatively affects the SmC oper- ation, namely who should bear any raised civil liability.
5. Legal assessment of AI oracles’ impact upon SmC
As already stated, oracles serve as service providers con- veying data/information/knowledge from the off-chain world to a blockchain platform, or vice versa (obligation of re- sult).154 Any system’s malfunction, or transmission of inaccu- rate data/information/knowledge (henceforth failure) affects SmC and may result, inter allia, in the following situations: (a) in SmC non-performance, although it should have been self-performed (e.g. when an AI oracle conveys inaccurate data about weather conditions, so that the SmC is not self- performed, and the money is not transferred from the insur- ance company’s portfolio to the claimer’s one on time); (b) in SmC self-performance, although it should not have been self-performed (e.g. when an AI oracle transmits inaccurate data about weather conditions and the SmC is self-performed, when in fact money should not be released to the claimer; (c) a SmC was concluded, although it should not have been concluded (e.g. a loan-SmC is concluded because the AI ora- cle transmitted inaccurate information about the creditwor- thiness of a loan applicant; had it conveyed accurate informa- tion thereof, the SmC would have never been concluded; or (d) a SmC was not concluded, although it should have been

concluded (e.g. a sales SmC was not concluded because the AI oracle conveyed incorrect data about the stock’s price; had it transmitted accurate information thereof, the SmC would have been concluded). The first two types of failures (a, b) ap- ply to any kind of SmC, i.e. to the SmC as a tool for a contract’s self-performance and self-execution, to a hybrid contract, as well as to a stand-alone SmC, while the last ones (c, d) ap- ply only to the stand-alone SmC since it is the only kind that is concluded entirely on-chain through the blockchain plat- form. These situations raise the following issues: first, which person should be held liable in the case of damage; the par- ties (if so, which of them) or the blockchain platform? Second, if one of the contractual parties, or the platform accordingly, is held liable, can they claim compensation from the AI ora- cle user and/or producer (provider/designer), or against the AI oracle itself, accordingly? Further, as far as the third situation is concerned, is the contact valid and legally binding upon the contractual parties, or can they be released by their contrac- tual obligations? Accordingly, in the last case, who should be held liable for the SmC non-conclusion and bear the cost of damage? These questions are going to be answered immedi- ately below.
5.1. SmC non-performance due to AI oracles’ failure
From a legal perspective, when a SmC is not performed due to the AI oracle’s failure, there is a breach of (smart) contract.155 The person bearing the raised liability depends, primarily, on who requested the involvement of the AI oracle in the blockchain platform: the contractual parties or the blockchain platform?
5.1.1. Should the AI oracle become involved upon a party’s command, this party should bear any contractual liability.156 For example, like in case of an off-chain tool that does not function appropriately and negatively affects the transac- tional outcome, contractual parties should bear the liability in case the AI oracles they use are defective or convey inac- curate data. For instance, in the case of a defective computa- tional oracle, which releases a wrong outcome onto the plat- form, the party which uses the AI oracle bears the liability. One would reach the same conclusion, even if they do not accept the role of AI autonomous systems as mere tools, but rather as ‘independent parties’ endowed with ‘legal personhood’,157 or as ‘electronic slaves’ or ‘hybrid persons’: like in the case of experts that the contractual parties consult in the off-chain world before executing their contractual obligations, the risk of inaccurate knowledge is upon the contractual party who asked for it.
Of course, a differentiated liability allocation can result from an agreement between the contractual parties,158 un- der general legal conditions, while the platform itself can also predict and manage the issue. Indeed, it will be beneficial for both contractual parties, should they agree in advance which AI oracle is going to be used, namely which AI oracle they both

trust, and what will happen in the case of an AI oracle’s fail- ure. For instance, they can agree that none of them will be held liable and that the SmC should be performed anyway, retro- spectively. As far as the liability of the AI oracle is concerned, the prevalent opinion159 holds the AI user accountable,160 as has already discussed (see above, Section 2.2.). Between the AI user/owner and the on-chain contractual party who asks for the AI oracle’s assistance, a service agreement161 (or par- ticularly, in the EU, a digital content service based on the recent Directive 2019/770)162 is concluded but breached due to the AI system’s failure, so the latter can claim compensation against the former for non-performance of the (service) contract.163
Further, the AI provider or designer can be held liable for the AI oracle’s failure as producer or manufacturer of a de- fective product. In civil law jurisdictions, which are member- states of the European Union, this is a strict liability regime based on the European Directive 84/374 for product liability,164 which is due to be amended soon.165 Accordingly, in com- mon law jurisdictions, it is based, de lege ferenda, inter allia, on the Consumer Protection Act 1987 in the UK, and on sec- tion 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts in the USA, which are strict liability regimes, too.166 Otherwise, compen- sation claims against the AI provider or designer can be based on ‘traditional’ rules of law, like the fault-based tort liability, or, de lege ferenda, vicarious liability, as well as liability for parents and animal keepers.167

160 Although the term ‘user’ is more appropriate to describe the person who exploits an AI system, in the present paper the term ‘owner’ is adopted because the term ‘user’ is used to refer to the contractual parties of a SmC.

163 The same conclusion applies also for the supporters of the mu- tatis mutandis application of the rules of law about representative (see above, Section 2.2.) as well as for the proponents of the theo- ries of the “AI legal personhood”, “electronic slaves” and “e-person” (see also above, Section 2.2) with the difference that in the last three cases the service contract will have been concluded between the contractual party and the AI system itself.

 5.1.2. On the other hand, when the involvement of AI or- acles takes place upon the platform’s command, it is ques- tionable whether the contractual parties should bear any contractual liability, since they seem to have no default for the produced outcome: even when they know that the up- loaded information is inaccurate, they cannot intervene in smart code and inhibit its automatic execution, or trigger it, respectively. For instance, in the afore-mentioned example, the private insurance company holds no responsibility for the fact that the money was not transferred to the claimer’s portfolio and could not alter the predefined outcome. This is crucial for civil law systems, where contractual liability is based on the debtor’s default, contrary to common law ones where contractual liability is strict, i.e., irrespective of the debtor’s default, but for frustration; in this case, it is essen- tial that force majeure clauses be agreed between contractual parties.
Further, given that the AI oracle has intervened upon the platform’s command, the liability of the blockchain platform should also be investigated.168 Platforms’ liability depends on the following: first, on its role as a provider of information so- ciety services, according to the relevant definition of the Eu- ropean Directive 2000/31 on Electronic Commerce,169 or of au- tonomous ones, i.e. whether they act as mere intermediaries, just facilitating the transaction on-chain, or have a more cru- cial role in the transaction;170 second, on its legal nature as a public or private (permissioned) network.171 In the latter case, it is reasonably expected that the platform will be responsi- ble for (smart) contract non-performance, so it could be held liable (at least jointly with any liable contractual party) for the breach of (smart) contract.
Should the blockchain platform be held liable for (smart) contract non-performance, it can claim compensation against the AI owner for breach of the service contract (or the digital service contract), which has been concluded between them, according to the prevalent opinion (see above, Section 2.2). Moreover, in the case of defective AI design, the AI providers or designers could also be held liable, according to the afore- mentioned rules of law (i.e., the European Directive 85/374, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the section 402A of the Re- statement (Second) of Torts). In case these legal enactments do not apply, their liability can be based on tort law, or, de lege

5.2. SmC performance due to AI oracles’ failure
On the other hand, it is also possible that a SmC is self- performed due to an AI oracle’s failure, although it should not have been performed. In this case, there is no breach of contract, but rather a situation of unjust enrichment:172 one party (e.g., the insurance claimer) receives a certain benefit at the expense of another (e.g., of the insurance company) via the blockchain platform without justification. Indeed, in the above-mentioned paradigm, there is no valid legal basis for the insurance claimer’s enrichment, because the insured risk (e.g., a hurricane or an earthquake) has not occurred and it was the AI system’s failure that enabled the unduly payment to be made. Accordingly, because the AI oracle released in- accurate data about stock prices in the blockchain platform, the SmC was self-performed, and the stocks were sold at the wrong price.
The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution, i.e., the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. Regarding SmC, restitution means that the SmC must be deleted from the ledger retrospectively, or that another SmC with the ad- verse outcome must be concluded and performed.
Further, also in this case, the AI oracle’s failure constitutes a breach of the service contract, which has been concluded between the contractual party, or the blockchain platform ac- cordingly, and the AI owner.173 What has already been written above in relation to the liability of the AI owner as well as the AI provider or designer applies also in this case (see above, Section 5.1).
5.3. SmC conclusion due to AI oracles’ failure
Further, when an AI oracle is used at the conclusion stage of a (stand-alone) SmC, its failure can result in the conclusion of a (stand-alone) SmC that should not have been concluded. For instance, because an AI oracle wrongfully assesses the cred- itworthiness of a loan applicant and releases this inaccurate information to the blockchain platform, a loan-SmC is con- cluded between the platform users, i.e. the applicant and the credit institution, that otherwise would never have been con- cluded.
In this case, it is questionable whether the contractual party (e.g. the credit institution) can be released from their contractual obligations. Taking into account the above anal- ysis, one should accept that, when the AI oracle becomes in- volved in the blockchain platform, upon a contractual party’s command, then this party should be held legally bound by the concluded (stand-alone) SmC; that is to say, the (stand-alone) SmC is held valid, and the contractual party who commanded the AI oracle’s involvement should perform - in fact, accept the self-performance of - their contractual obligations. The only way to be released from their contractual obligations is by in-

173 Or with the AI oracle itself, should it be treated as a legal person or an electronic slave or as a hybrid person.
  
voking the rules of law about mistake,174 if it is so important, i.e. to contend that they would never have entered the (stand- alone smart) contract, had they known the true situation, ac- cording to the relevant provisions of each jurisdiction.175
In the above paradigm, where the AI oracle conveyed in- accurate information about the creditworthiness of the loan- applicant, the importance of the mistake is obvious. However, in other paradigms the contractual parties may face great dif- ficulty in proving their mistake. Where they do not rescind the (stand-alone) SmC, they could claim compensation against the AI owner for a breach of contract that they have concluded, as well as against the AI provider or designer for defective de- sign, based on the above analysis (see above, Section 5.1.1).
Further, should the AI oracles take part in a contractual procedure upon the blockchain platform’s command, the SmC is valid, but the parties are entitled to the right to rescind it on the grounds of it being a mistake. In such a case, it will be easier for the contractual parties to prove their mistake. In addition, they can claim compensation against the blockchain platform, especially if the latter is a private network, and pro- vides the services, i.e. the infrastructure of the platform and the rest of the operations, with a fee (see also above, Section 5.1.2).
5.4. SmC non-conclusion due to AI oracles’ failure
An AI oracle’s failure can also result in the non-conclusion of a (stand-alone) SmC, even when it was supposed to have been concluded. For instance, if an AI oracle transmitted incorrect information about a stock price (e.g. if it states it is higher or lower than its actual value), then the SmC would not be con- cluded, because, according to its predefined conditions, the contract can only be concluded when the stock price’s value reaches a certain level.
On the one hand, should the AI oracle intervene in the contractual procedure upon the parties’ command, the lat- ter bears the risk, i.e. they lose the opportunity to conclude a profitable contract. Nonetheless, they can submit compensa- tion claims (especially loss of profit) against the AI owner for breaching the contract that has been agreed between them. Accordingly, the AI provider or designer can be held liable, ei- ther as the producer of a defective product, or according to any of the other legal bases already discussed above (i.e. law of torts, vicarious liability, and parents’ or animal keepers’ li- ability) (see above, Section 5.1.1).
On the other hand, if the AI oracle took part in the con- tractual procedure upon the blockchain platform’s command, the contractual parties could submit compensation claims against the blockchain platform for breach of contract be- cause of the improper function of the platform. However, as already mentioned above (see above Section 5.1.b), the liabil- ity of the blockchain platforms depends on various factors: first, on their role as intermediaries (provider of information society services) or as crucial-structural parties of the trans-

action; second, on their legal nature as public or private (per- missioned) networks; third, on the agreement between them and the platforms’ users. Usually when the service (i.e. the in- frastructure of the platform and the operations it performs) is offered by a private blockchain network for a fee, it would be agreed, or would be reasonably expected, that the platform bears the liability for the proper operation of its services; so, any improper operation of the platform constitutes a breach of contract that establishes their contractual liability for non- performance.
Subsequently, if the blockchain platform is held liable, then it can claim compensation against the AI owner for breach of the contract that has been agreed between them, as well as against the AI provider or designer, in accordance with the above legal analysis (see above Section 5.1.2).
6. Conclusions
The interconnection of AI and blockchain technology is ex- pected to bring significant advantages to transactions, altering for good the way people carry out them. Since the invention of the Internet, the interaction of this cutting-edge technology is going to be the next real ‘big thing’ in the trade industry. However, it also poses significant legal concerns that will only increase in future, as both fields make rapid progress.
The present paper constitutes a preliminary study of the interconnection of these novel technologies, putting em- phasis on the mechanisms this interconnection is achieved through, the oracles. Should these mechanisms be AI systems, particularly an autonomous one, they can have extended use in transactions carried out through blockchain technology, from the formation and conclusion of a SmC to its perfor- mance, execution, and undoing, thus, maximizing SmC poten- tial.
However, the use of AI oracles may also raise several le- gal issues in the event of failure. The present paper focused especially on the contractual liability issues in the case of po- tential AI oracles’ failures, although non-contractual liability may also exist. The above analysis has shown that any oracle’s failure can result, inter allia, in these legal situations: in a SmC non-performance, i.e., a breach of a (smart) contract (see 5.1); in a SmC performance which in fact constitutes an unjust en- richment (see 5.2); in the conclusion of an undesirable SmC (see 5.3); or in the non-conclusion of a desirable one (see 5.4).
Moreover, all persons participating in the ‘smart contrac- tual procedure’, i.e. the contractual parties, as well as the blockchain platform and the AI owner (or the AI system it- self), can be held liable, depending on who requested the AI oracle’s intervention in the transaction and who is responsible for its proper operation; should the AI oracle intervene in the “smart contract procedure” upon the contractual parties’ com- mand, then the latter bear the most risk, based on the afore- mentioned situations, i.e. they bear the contractual liability (see 5.1.1), or they are obliged to restitute the unjust enrich- ment (see 5.2), or they are legally bound by a smart (voidable) contract (see 5.3), or, lastly, they lose the opportunity to con- clude a profitable (smart) contract. In all these cases, the con- tractual parties are entitled to the right to claim compensation against: (a) the AI user/owner for non-performance, and/or (b)

  the AI provider or designer. The latter (i.e. the AI provider or designer) can be held liable, either as the producer of a de- fected product, or based on the tort liability regime or, de lege ferenda, on vicarious liability, or parents’ or animal keepers’ li- ability.
Accordingly, should the AI oracle intervene in the ‘smart contractual procedure’ upon the blockchain platform’s com- mand, especially when the latter is a private (permissioned) one that plays a crucial role in the transaction and offers its infrastructure for a fee, then it is the platform itself that will bear any increased risk, i.e. they compensate the contractual parties for the non-performance of the SmC (see 5.1.2), or for a performance that should not have happened (see 5.2), or for the conclusion of the stand-alone SmC that should not have been concluded (see 5.3), or for the non-conclusion of the stand-alone SmC that should not have been concluded (see 5.4). Third parties, like the AI providers or designers, may also bear liability in the case of defective AI as the producers of a defective product,176 or according to the tort law liability regime, or the vicarious liability, or parents’ or animal keepers’ liability, de lege ferenda.
Given that a legislative initiative has already begun, at least regarding AI, and a new legal framework is going to be enacted soon, the legal doctrine should focus on the transactions car- ried out through blockchain platforms, with the aid of AI sys- tems, and address the newly raised legal issues consistently. The present paper aspires to provide some appropriate legal directions for handling the legal issues raised by the intercon- nection of SmC and AI.
