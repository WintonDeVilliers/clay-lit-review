ABSTRACT
The concept of Industry 4.0 develops from a technological base - a set of technologies with a profoundly
transformative character. The development of the concept from an essentially manufacturing base to other domains - Services 4.0, Government 4.0, Tourism 4.0, etc. - tells us that the concept is now much broader in scope
and has much broader transformative potential, both from an economic, social and an environmental sustainability point of view.
In this context, multinationals may play a very important role, as these companies are considered to play a key
role in promoting sustainable development. This study seeks to understand whether there is evidence that
multinationals are playing this role by analyzing the literature published on Industry 4.0 and seeking to identify
in the literature which is published on multinationals a bias towards a greater focus on environmental and social
issues.
The study conducted does not confirm this bias. The study shows that environmental and social issues are
modestly present in the literature/research about Industry 4.0 but are no longer present in the specific literature
on multinationals. The study thus challenges us to develop and implement research agendas on the topic and
mobilize academia towards research in this domain. Such reorientation of research will be determinant to
accelerate the implementation processes of Industry 4.0, exploring in an integrated way its transformative potential in the economic and technological dimensions, but also environmental and social.
1. Introduction
Since the 1980s and the publication of the Brundtland Report - Our
Common Future (Brundtland, 1987) the challenges facing humanity
have been effectively recognized and the emerging negative social,
environmental, and economic consequences are the result of an unsustainable system (Leal Filho et al., 2020). Implementing more sustainable
practices has become a critical point on business agendas in the past
decades to address the exacerbation of the climate and planetary crisis
we are currently experiencing. There are different drivers that prompt
the transition process to a more sustainable society (Mont and Power,
2010) and the emergence of environmental and social dimensions,
together with the economic dimension, as determining elements of
sustainable development, is materialized in a succession of initiatives,
from governments and non-public entities, such as NGOs and
companies, which seek to make contributions to overcome those challenges and to create more sustainable practices (Murray et al., 2010).
Literature shows (Ajwani-Ramchandani et al., 2021) that multinationals, specifically, may have a very pernicious or beneficial role in the
implementation of actions that enhance sustainable development and
mitigating the impacts of climate change and they are viewed as both
responsible and capable to implement changes to seek more sustainable
practices. Multinationals are frequently large corporations with a presence across multiple countries, institutional frameworks, and cultural
contexts, with a large footprint that impacts many stakeholders (Sun
et al., 2021). Indeed, multinationals are agents of intuitional change
(Oriaifo et al., 2020), due to their capacity to operate in multiple geographies and their increased competitive advantage and beneficial
position to create change, exerting their powerful position. Moreover,
multinationals are seen as leaders and small and medium enterprises

(SMEs), directly or indirectly, commonly follow their practices (Palazzo
et al., 2017). Additionally, the important role of multinationals is also
exemplified by the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,
which includes a set of voluntary standards and principles to facilitate
the adoption of sustainable development, pre-empting the means and
the power multinationals have to act on these principles and implement
them (OECD, 2021).
We also know from literature (Ghobakhloo, 2020) that digitalization
and the rapidly changing technological scene, including the appearance
of the advanced technologies of the most recent industrial revolution,
Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is often associated with the sustainable development
agenda. Literature and anecdotal cases (Gupta et al., 2021) show that
digitalization and I4.0 tools can greatly benefit the introduction of
sustainable development goals and initiatives and these tools introduce
disruptive and transformational change, which provide a great potential
to act upon the social, economic, and environmental initiatives of sustainable development. Therefore, there are reasons to believe that
digitalization and I4.0 can be used as tools by multinationals, who are in
a better position to push forward fast, overarching, and more consistent
development of a sustainable society, acting as agents of institutional
and societal change.
Nonetheless, sustainability, multinational and digitalization literature, focusing on I4.0 tools, is quite disperse (Lepore et al., 2021). On the
one hand, the sustainability literature talks about the importance of
digital transformation, I4.0 tools and multinationals (Ajwani-Ramchandani et al., 2021) and concurrently, the multinational literature
talks about sustainability and how multinationals can drive change to
achieve more sustainable practices with digital transformation (George
and Schillebeeckx, 2022). However, there is yet to exist a reconciled and
holistic way to investigate who or what is a main enabler of sustainability change and where the gaps and missing pieces are. Therefore, it is
important to bring these concepts together in a systematic way to understand where emphasis should be put, how the multinational literature connects I4.0 tools towards sustainable goals and where
investments should be prioritized in terms of environmental and social
issues.
It is in this context that this study is developed, which seeks to assess
whether multinationals are acknowledged as playing a more decisive
role in environmental and social aspects when addressing the topic of
I4.0, as could be projected by the OECD Guidelines. To this end, this
study aims to better understand the difference, the contribution and
important role of both multinationals and I4.0 tools, and how much the
multinational academic literature is focusing on using I4.0 towards a
sustainable future. Therefore, to support the current transition to more
sustainable practices, this study highlights where emphasis is made in
the literature and where attention is lacking by comparing the differences across two important body of literature that both notably
contribute to sustainable development. This way, this study can help to
accurately proportion where the mobilization of multinational and I4.0
research should be aimed at to further support the sustainable development transition. To achieve this goal, this paper has adopted a systematic literature review, to collect the relevant studies in the field and
used a content analysis method, using MaxQDA software to compare
two sets of articles. In the content analysis, a documentary-based study
was conducted, focusing on two samples of academic articles, one of the
generic articles on I4.0 and another of articles that analyze the topic of
I4.0 and focus on multinationals. The aim of the systematic review and
the content analysis was to understand the intersection and the
connection between multinational and I4.0 literature and the extent to
which certain keywords (retrieved from the OECD Guidelines) are
referenced in the I4.0 literature, and the I4.0 literature in combination of
and with the focus on multinationals.
The systematic literature review and content analysis point to several
implications. First, the key terms and concepts associated with sustainable development are not majorly found in the multinational literature.
Conversely, literature of I4.0 is more concerned with the sustainable
development topics and therefore these concepts are more prevalent in
the I4.0 literature. Second, this study encourages us to shift our attention
from multinationals to the literature of I4.0 and technologies when
investigating sustainable development. This underlines the I4.0 tools’
capability to enable transformative change in the sustainable development agenda.
In the next sections, the paper presents a literature review, the
sample and method, results, discussion and conclusions, and the last
section with limitations and future research.
2. Literature review
2.1. Multinationals and industry 4.0
Both Sommer (2015) and Ingaldi and Ulewicz (2020) argue that the
implementation process of I4.0 has been mainly based on large companies. According to Azevedo and Almeida (2021), these companies
have advantages of scale, reach, and efficiency. For these authors, large
companies also have advantages both in terms of human and capital
resources, which allow them to test and evaluate new technologies.
Müller (2019) argues that, in addition to resource limitations, small
companies also have low bargaining power and inadequate business
models, which make them potentially unsuitable to implement I4.0.
In a significant number of cases the large companies that are usually
referred to as associated with I4.0 are large multinational companies (e.
g.: Bosch, Siemens, or SAP, referred to by Sommer, 2015 or General
Electric (GE), Siemens, ABB, and Intel, referred to by Türkes¸ et al.
(2019). Accordingly, Ungerman et al. (2018) argue that multinational
companies are quicker to embrace digital technologies and processes
largely because of the investment pressure required by new technologies, which create constraints on SMEs and relegate them to a follower
position. Rodiˇc (2017) follows this up when he states that the "highest
levels of implementation of Industry 4.0 can be seen [in 2017] in Germany and in multinational technology companies".
At another level, Chavez et al. (2022) state that the literature on I4.0,
both academic and more business-related, namely those published by
consulting firms, has focused mainly on large companies, with a dearth
of works on SMEs. If the scenario described by Ungerman et al. (2018) is
confirmed, it is understandable that the literature, seeking to describe
and analyze what is new, focuses mainly on large companies.
2.2. Multinationals and sustainable development
Kim et al. (2022) show from studying the South Korean reality that
multinationals can be determinants in the implementation of sustainable
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Cherkasova and
Nenuzhenko (2022) reached similar conclusions, although with the
nuance that the origin of the firm is also relevant.
The previously mentioned bias in the literature, in favour of multinationals, seems not to be confined only to I4.0. Pereira et al. (2022)
identified a similar bias in the published literature on the Circular
Economy, a topic close to some of those addressed in this research
regards to the contributions of multinationals’ practices to circularity,
the results are not so uniform. Thus, although there are some efforts
towards the development of conceptual models that argue for the
importance of the adoption of circularity practices by multinationals (e.
g.: Ly, 2021), the results of empirical studies do not reveal uniform results. For instance, Morea et al. (2021) find strong evidence of the
effective adoption of circularity practices by multinationals, Ajwani-Ramchandani et al. (2021) point out, that large multinational companies
look at their operation and separate products from packaging, which
leads their managers to think that when the product is consumed, their
responsibility ends, and the packaging, as waste, becomes the responsibility of the government, which, of course, is a practice far away
from circularity. However, Obrad and Gherhes¸ (2018) show, from a
study of multinationals in the automotive sector in Romania, that

companies are aware that Corporate Social Responsibility brings them
advantages in the long term, both in external terms (arising from
reputational gains, in consolidating their brand as an employer, their
competitive advantage in the market, their media visibility) and also in
internal terms (through strengthening the organizational culture and
generating greater involvement from the employees themselves).
2.3. Guidelines and frameworks of sustainability
The activities of multinationals and the impact of their activities on
the economies and societies in which they operate were already recognized by the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social
Affairs in the early 1970s (see DESA-UN, 1973). This document has
already identified a set of aspects on which the activities of multinationals may have an impact, ranging from human resources, the
exploitation of natural resources and technology transfer issues
(DESA-UN, 1973, p.1).
In the fifty years between that document and today, the United Nations has developed important work in favour of sustainability. Multinationals have often been present or very close to this work, as is the
case, for example, with the UN Global Compact (https://www.
unglobalcompact.org/). In this initiative, which involves the UN and
entities from civil society, business, and public entities, of the companies
that are present, many of them are multinationals (note that all the
companies mentioned above - Bosch, Siemens, SAP, General Electric,
ABB, and Intel - are members of the initiative).
It was within the scope of the UN Global Compact activities that the
Ten Principles (see Table 1) were established to guide companies in
developing their strategies, policies, and procedures, and creating cultures of integrity to ensure that companies fulfill their basic responsibilities to people and the planet in a way that guarantees their
long-term success.
Although not specifically aimed at multinationals, these principles
have a field of application par excellence in these companies (see
Muchlinski, 2021; Williams, 2004). It is also among the multinational
signatories that significant violations of these principles are found. Ullah
et al. (2021) in a study of human rights violations by multinationals,
identified 273 transgressions by 160 companies, of which more than
90% were signatories to the UN Global Compact, leading the authors to
question the effectiveness of the initiative. Another initiative, from a
multilateral body, is the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning
Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy developed by the International Labour Organization in 2017 (ILO, 2017). The Declaration
naturally focuses on labour issues and is structured in five sections, an
initial one, General policies, and then four thematic sections: Employment, Training, Conditions of work and life, and Industrial relations.
Ullah et al., 2021 identified in relation to this declaration similar
non-compliances to those recorded in the UN Global Compact. This has
led both Ago (2020) and Cerni ˇ ˇc (2020) to question the Declaration’s
governance model and accountability.
The UN Global Compact initiative is not specifically aimed at multinationals and the International Labour Organisation’s initiative,
although aimed at multinationals, focuses only on labour issues.
Conversely, it is important to note that the OECD has an initiative specifically aimed at multinationals to guide their efforts towards responsible business conduct. This initiative is called the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises, which will be analyzed in the next section.
The OECD Guidelines act as a major benchmark for the behaviour of
multinationals being referred to in both the UN Global contact and the
ILO tripartite declaration in 2017.
2.4. OECD and the multinational enterprises – historical framework
The OECD approved in 1976 a set of guidelines for multinational
enterprises, whose adoption was voluntary, and which aimed, among
other things, at transfer pricing and other transactions between firms
belonging to the same multinational enterprise (Hagg, 1984). This first
version of the guidelines is not, however, a stand-alone document. The
guidelines originally appeared as an annex to the OECD Declaration on
International Investment and Multinational Enterprises (Reinert et al.,
2016).
A first revision, in 1979, maintains, in general terms, the organization (Tully, 2001) of the guidelines in nine chapters/themes - General
Policies, Disclosure, Employment and Industrial Relations, Environment, Combating Bribery; Consumer Interests; Science and Technology;
Competition; Taxation (Hagg, 1984) a structure that majorly lasts until
today (the most recent version includes an autonomous chapter on
human rights (OECD, 2011)). However, it does substantively change
procedures (Rojot, 1985) namely with the introduction of National
Contact Points (NCP). The Guidelines have been subject to successive
revisions (1984, 1991, 2000 and 2011, see Van ’T Foort, 2017 for a fuller
description of developments).
However, Reinert et al. (2016) and van ’T Foort (2017) classify
guidelines as soft law, given the non-binding nature and voluntary
adherence of this model of regulation. This model creates transparency
and accountability problems (de Jonge, 2015; Sanchez, 2015; Van ’T
Foort, 2017) for which NCPs should be a response, according to Sanchez
(2015) which, in the author’s opinion, has shortcomings. Bhatt and
Erdem Türkelli (2021) and Schekulin (2011) also highlight the importance of strengthening NCPs.
2.5. The OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises (this section is
based on OECD, 2011)
The document is clear about its nature “The OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises are recommendations addressed by governments to multinational enterprises operating in or from adhering
countries [they] provide voluntary principles and standards for
responsible business conduct” (our bold). The mandate of the
Guidelines - a recommendation -, the model for companies to join -
voluntary - and the ultimate purpose - responsible business conduct - is
thus unequivocal. Responsible business conduct appears almost as an
ethical imperative, something that companies must implement, or
otherwise, should implement if they want to rise to the challenge that
societies set them if they want to seize the opportunity – “Multinational
enterprises have the opportunity to implement best practice policies
for sustainable development that seek to ensure coherence between
economic, environmental and social objectives” (p.14, our bold).
But this behaviour is also beneficial for companies because it

facilitates the creation of more open, competitive, and properly regulated markets, and multinationals are in the best position to exploit the
opportunities provided by markets with these characteristics and thus
promote sustainable development. It is precisely this potential of multinationals to promote sustainability that is reinforced by the OECD
(2011, p.14) when it states “The ability of multinational enterprises to
promote sustainable development is greatly enhanced when trade and
investment are conducted in a context of open, competitive and
appropriately regulated markets”, evidently markets with these characteristics are especially favorable for multinationals.
It is within this framework that the Guidelines propose 15 general
principles, of which we highlight "Companies should”:
1. Contribute to economic, environmental, and social progress with
a view to achieving sustainable development.
2. Respect the internationally recognized human rights of those
affected by their activities.
3. Encourage local capacity building through close co-operation
with the local community […].
4. Encourage human capital formation, by creating employment
opportunities and facilitating training opportunities for
employees.
5. Refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated
in the statutory or regulatory framework related to human rights,
environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial incentives, or other issues.
6. Support and uphold good corporate governance principles and
develop and apply good corporate governance practices […].
7. Develop and apply effective self-regulatory practices and management systems that foster a relationship of confidence and
mutual trust between enterprises and the societies […].
8. Promote awareness of and compliance by workers employed by
multinational enterprises with respect to company policies […].
9. Refrain from discriminatory or disciplinary action against
workers who make bona fide reports to management or, as
appropriate, to the competent public authorities, on practices
that contravene the law, the Guidelines or the enterprise’s policies. […]
14. Engage with relevant stakeholders to provide meaningful opportunities for their views to be considered in relation to planning
and decision making for projects or other activities that may
significantly impact local communities.
15. Abstain from any improper involvement in local political
activities.»
These principles are then operationalized in nine guidelines that the
following table (Table 2) presents in a summarized form. These guidelines constitute the core recommendations.
We can thus conclude that large multinationals are crucial for the
implementation of I4.0, but can also, as Kolk et al. (2017) point out, play
an important role in the implementation of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs).
2.6. Industry 4.0 and the sustainable development
Technology is a key enabler of change and innovative practices, and
the emergence of the concept I4.0 is tied by to 2011, when the German
Government introduced the term to enhance the competitiveness of its
manufacturing industry (e.g., Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019; Zambon et al., 2019; Masood and Sonntag, 2020; Moeuf et al., 2020). In
academic journals, the first indexed articles are from 2013/2014 (e.g.,
Drath and Horch, 2014) and by then, Kagermann et al. (2013, p. 54)
underlined the role of I4.0 tools as both solutions that are technologically efficient and also socially sustainable. Therefore, I4.0 is viewed to
play an enabling role in transitioning to sustainable development
practices.
To understand the role and impact of I4.0, it is important to understand how the concept emerged and what its basis are. The first industrial revolution emerged from the mechanization of processes and this
period dates back to 1760. It introduced significant innovation and
marks the date of the first mechanical loom. Then, it is relatively
consensual that the second industrial revolution begins while the second
half of the 19th century was already well advanced (Domini, 2022;
Uzunkaya, 2020; Von Tunzelmann, 1997). Around that time (1886),
Henry Towne makes his famous communication "The Engineer as
Economist" which is considered by many the beginning of the development of scientific management and management in general (e.g.,
Georgiou, 2014; Stefanov & Stefanov, 2022).
The decades that follow, from 1870 to 1914, are marked by the
statement of the second industrial revolution (Homburg, 2018; Squicciarini, 2020), as well as the confirmation of scientific management as
the more advanced management model (Frederick Taylor published

Shop Management in 1903 and The Principles of Scientific Management
in 1911, and he also published Motion Study in the same year; - see
Lopes (2007)). While these changes are happening, movements, like the
Welfare Work, try to make even more profound social changes by relying
on businesses to support them (see, for example, Campbell and Nelson,
1972; Eklund, 1999). Mller-Jentsch (1991) analyzes the processes and
developments of labor relations and discovers unique and distinctive
ways of organizing the economy, organizations, and society in each
Industrial Revolution. As distinguishing characteristics from earlier eras,
the third industrial revolution is characterized by globalization, the
development of internationally distributed manufacturing systems, and
new personal forms of information access (Simsir and Mete, 2022).
Large firms play a critical part in these social change processes that
go hand in hand with technological revolutions. The contribution of the
NCR corporation (National Cash Register, an important industrial corporation founded in Dayton, Ohio, in 1884 and acquired by AT&T in
1991) to the implementation of the Welfare Work is discussed by
Campbell and Nelson (1972). A significant portion of Frederick Taylor’s
work was done at Bethlehem Steel firm, which was a big steel firm at the
time (Taylor, 2008). The 40-h workweek was first implemented in the
USA thanks in large part to Henry Ford (Hunnicutt, 1984). Large electrical corporations are supporting the Hawthorne studies, which will be
important for the implementation of the Human Relations School (Zoller
and Muldoon, 2020). To refer back to I4.0 and its relation to sustainable
development, we highlight that in academic publications, the first
indexed articles that simultaneously address the topic of I4.0 and sustainability date from 2015, with Gerlitz (2015) advocating a design (for
I4.0) that also proposes value in terms of sustainability, environmental
and social efficiency and Prause (2015) arguing that I4.0 paves the way
for new business models that also encompass new concepts of product
life cycle sustainability.
Nonetheless, implementation of I4.0 tools in the pursuit of sustainable development is not without its challenges and barriers (de Jesus
and Mendonça, 2018). For example, Kipper et al. (2020) analyzing a
large set of articles published about I4.0 (1882 articles) identify four
main challenges in this area: technological, collaboration/integration,
implementation and management. It is in this last dimension that
themes such as human resources or sustainability are gathered. Lopes
(2022) also identifies a cluster of relevant topics in the scope of I4.0
studies in SMEs related to Social Issues and Sustainability.
If we consider only the social dimension, and the internal dimension
of companies - their employees -, we come across a consistent literature
telling us that the human factor is highly relevant in the adoption of I4.0.
This is what Trotta and Garengo (2018) summarize when they argue that
the issue of Human Resource Management is fundamental for I4.0,
considering, moreover, that several other authors recognize its importance in the successful implementation of I4.0 projects. In the same line
of analysis, Ivanov et al. (2021) surveyed 238 researchers from 43
countries about the factors that most significantly inhibit the adoption of
I4.0 in their country. The results of that study show that human factor
aspects are of significant importance in the adoption of I4.0 (the six most
important facts, in order of importance (emphasis ours): Lack of understanding of the nature of I4.0; Lack of strategic vision; Need to
find/place competent personnel; Need to retrain workers; Lack of access to
capital; Acceptance of workers). The significant social impact of I4.0 can
be also be felt on the community level, which is what van Rensburg et al.
(2019) show in an analysis applied to the African reality.
Therefore, in the context of I4.0, Human Resources gain importance,
on the one hand, due to the fact that significant transformations of
employment profiles and skills are likely to occur (Kagermann et al.,
2013), and, on the other hand, due to the fact that I4.0 is generating a
paradigm shift in the role of human resources, involving the gradual
transition of the workforce from machine operators to problem solvers
and decision makers, empowering them by providing aggregated and
visualized information in real time (Furstenau et al., 2020); Ghobakhloo
et al., 2021). In other words, not only it is the profile of jobs and skills
that is changing, but it is the content of the work itself that is changing or
put another way "[I.40] will challenge us on how to reinvent jobs in a
world where machines will take our jobs" (Wahl, 2015, p. 241).
Nonetheless, this new framework, created by I4.0, constitutes, in the
opinion of Furstenau et al. (2020), a challenge for companies that have
to be able to develop their human capital according to the new skills
required by I4.0 from the implementation of organizational changes and
the adoption of new management practices to ensure the efficient use of
their intangible assets.
The literature also highlights a close relationship between I4.0 and
environmental issues, especially those related to the circular economy
(Neligan et al., 2022). For example, Furstenau et al. (2020) note that
there is a growing number of studies that relate I4.0 with sustainability,
proving the strong relationship between the two topics, so it can be said
that sustainability is assumed as one of the pillars of smart
manufacturing. As a conclusion of their study of 894 articles, the authors
argue that in order to develop a more sustainable society, issues such as
circular economy, resource scarcity, lean manufacturing, energy problems, food production, process management and modeling, waste
reduction, reuse of raw materials, and social aspects should be deepened
in studies that simultaneously address I4.0 and sustainability. Ghobakhloo et al. (2021) also argue that the transformation associated with
I4.0 could address pressing issues of SDGs, particularly with regard to
manufacturing-economic development. As previously mentioned, the
circular economy has been particularly emphasized in many I4.0 related
articles (see, among others, Ajwani-Ramchandani et al., 2021; Bressanelli et al., 2018; Dantas et al., 2021; Dev et al., 2020; Lopes de Sousa
Jabbour et al., 2018; Nascimento et al., 2019; Rajput and Singh, 2019;
Rosa et al., 2020; Toth-Peter et al., 2023; Tseng et al., 2018; Yadav et al.,
2020).
Common point to all the mentioned articles is the need to recycle,
reuse and reduce (3R’s), core concepts of the circular economy. The
implementation of an economic development model based on circularity, and in particular the implementation of 3R’s solutions, requires
new and different answers from those applied so far (Blomsma et al.,
2019). The new technologies brought together in I4.0 - Cyber-Physical
Systems, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and Big Data - are
crucial to the development of these new answers, which is why they are
referred to in the generality of the articles cited (Yadav et al., 2020).
We previously highlighted that large firms play a critical role in social changes that accompany technological revolutions. Accordingly, the
technological change and the process of economic and social transformation are two columns that support the transformative process that
industrial revolutions bring about (see Fig. 1). To reiterate, large corporations have historically been a key player in these revolutionary

processes and have influenced the building of a leveled porch.
2.7. Synthesis and research model
Evidence is accumulating that the implementation of I4.0 is conditioned by social and environmental factors, but at the same time I4.0 is
also, at least in part, the solution to problems that exist in the domains of
those factors. For example, the contribution of I4.0 to the circular
economy and to the reskilling and upskilling of the workforce is very
significant. It is important to highlight that in all these processes, multinationals also exercise great possibilities to intervene and can be more
decisive in terms of what strategies get implemented. It is therefore
expected that this study will show this preponderance of multinationals,
that can be leading players in terms of sustainability. The research
framework that supports the research that follows thus is found at the
intersection between the concepts of multinationals, Industry 4.0, and
Sustainability, see Fig. 2.
3. Sample and method
This paper has adopted a systematic literature review (SLR) complemented with a content analysis to identify and analyze the different
patterns and themes (Xiao and Watson, 2019) in the intersection of I4.0
tools and multinationals with reference to the transition to sustainable
development. This methodological approach was used to provide a
synthesis of the relevant studies that exist in the field, and that would
become the basis of further analysis to analyze the extent of which
sustainable development is apparent in I4.0 literature, and I4.0 literature and multinational literature combined. To do the SLR, the initial
search was conducted in three databases, Scopus, Web of Science and
EBSCOHost Business Source Elite, which allowed access to a diverse
range of articles. The search string used the key concepts of multinationals and Industry 4.0.
The integrated search resulted in 123 articles across the three databases. After the initial selection process, duplicate articles, non-peer
reviewed articles and articles not written in English got excluded,
resulting in 69 articles to be analyzed. After the abstract analysis, 47
articles got included in the full-text review.
This systematic review was used to complement and serve as the
basis of a content analysis, which was then conducted in two distinct
samples of articles, based on a list of issues, drawn up by reviewing the
OECD document (2011):
• A sample composed of the articles resulting from the search, with the
following search string: ("Industry 4.0" and “Multinational”). The
search was restricted only to the fields: title, abstract and keywords.
This search resulted in a total of 45 articles, one of which was
eliminated because the full text was in Russian and another because
the full text was in German. This resulted in a set of 43 useable articles, having obtained the full text for all of them; and
• Another sample, established for comparative purposes, and therefore
of the same size (43 articles), was made up of the most cited articles,
resulting from the search, with the following search string: ("Industry
4.0"), with equal restriction in the search fields (title, abstract and
keywords). The full text was obtained for all articles. In both cases,
only articles published in Journals are considered ("Journals" flag
activated in Source Type).
The text of the 2011 version of the OECD Guidelines (OECD, 2011)
was used to generate a list of 195 keywords. The text of the ten chapters
setting out the conditions placed on multinationals - General Policies,
Disclosure, Human Rights, Employment and Industrial Relations, Environment, Combating Bribery, Bribe Solicitation and Extortion, Consumer Interests, Science and Technology, Competition, and Taxation -
was used to generate the keywords, with an attempt being made
wherever possible to establish a keyword for each of the paragraphs of
the text. All chapters include an explanatory note "Commentary on … "
which was not considered for the generation of the keywords. The list of
keywords can be found in Appendix 1. The keywords generated are thus
considered to constitute a complete lexicon of Environmental, Social,
and Governance (ESG) themes. The study is divided into two phases as
shown in Fig. 3.
4. Results
The search criteria did not specify any date ranges when conducting
the search. The articles covered a period between 2017 and 2022, with
the peak of articles in 2021 (Fig. 4). This implies that multinationals in
combination with I4.0 is an emerging research field, and therefore this
indicates that further research and analysis is warranted to discover and
better understand aspects of these concepts, separately, and at their
interaction, in relation to sustainable development.
Most studies are empirical, and many studies are qualitative, with
case study approach being the most dominant method used (Fig. 5).
There was only one article that used a longitudinal case study approach.
This is interesting that only one paper has adopted this approach given
that it is an emerging topic under study and a longitudinal study provides great insights and comparability in the future to better understand
how certain behaviors emerge and shape. The rest of the empirical
studies, at equal amounts, used mixed methods or quantitative methods,
with surveys being the most dominant method. Surveys allow to effectively cover a great range of geographical locations in a short time, as
this was the case in 2 articles, where the authors have investigated I4.0
in 15 and in 22 countries, using survey analysis. Lastly, 11 studies are
conceptual, with literature review and systematic reviews being the
most adopted methods.

Multinational companies are typically present in both emerging,
developing and developed countries. As this might bring along different
institutional and in cases cultural differences, it is no surprise that most
articles indicated what the context of their research was (Fig. 6). This
provides important differences and findings. Few articles did not specify
the context or country under investigation.
The SLR brings attention to different themes at the nexus of I4.0 and
multinationals in the trajectory of the sustainable development. There
were papers which investigated the benefits and implementation of I4.0
tools with the aim to enhance manufacturing, encourage collaboration
and optimize logistics (Barzotto and de Propris, 2021; Medoh and
Telukdarie, 2020) and many articles highlighted the resilience and
changing structure of global value chain as the benefits and outcomes of
I4.0 tools (Ahi et al., 2022; Dilyard et al., 2021; Opazo-Basaez ´ et al.,
2022). There were studies that investigated the financial side of sustainable development and looked at the cost and investment implications of I4.0 tools (Alami and ElMaraghy, 2021; Alarcon ´ et al., 2021;
Almeida et al., 2022). With reference to contextual factors, some articles
discussed the role of SMEs and developing and emerging economies,
where the conceptualization of different rights, duties and responsibilities become critical in order to effectively implement sustainable initiatives (del Giudice et al., 2021; Parida et al., 2021;
Rahamaddulla et al., 2021; Satyro et al., 2022; Tortorella et al., 2021).
With regards to the transformation process, additional challenges and
opportunities were highlighted (Battistello et al., 2021; Contador et al.,

2020; Martinelli et al., 2021)., and many articles focused on the human
resources factors, discussing the required skills and individual capabilities of employees (Bencsik, 2020; Fareri et al., 2020; Horvath ´ and
Szabo, ´ 2019). This rich context can also be appointed in the number of
journals where the articles were published. As it can be seen from Fig. 7,
the articles were published across 40 different journals, accounting for
almost 1 article per journal (the maximum being 4 articles per journal in
the Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management).
This systematic review was complemented by a content analysis,
aiming to better understand where the emphasis lies, the list of keywords from the OECD guidelines (Appendix 1), was used to analyze the
greater or lesser proximity of each of the sample articles to the ESG
themes, and to assess dominant themes in the literature analyzed. The
two samples (I4.0, the 43 most cited articles; MultiNat, the 43 articles
where the word multinational was identified) were analyzed using the
MaxQDA software.
The keywords constituted an "Inclusion List" and their presence was
searched for in the content of the articles. The following table (Table 3)
shows the results found. Accordingly:
• Twenty-one words were found in articles from both samples;
• Two words appear in the list only in MultiNat articles - human rights,
and reused - but their usage is low;
• Ten words appear in the list only in the I4.0 sample - contingency
plans, emission reduction, environmental impacts, environmental
management, greenhouse gas emissions, personal data, regulatory
framework, resource efficiency, resource utilization, and sustainable
consumption;
• Of these last words, only "resource efficiency" has a significant use;
• It can thus be observed the existence of a common lexicon, significant, and particular uses, although relatively residual;
• The core of most relevant keywords, consisting of twenty terms
related to:
a) the environment: environmental; environmental protection,
recycling, resource efficiency, natural resources, and environmental performance;
b) human resources: employees, training; skill, workers, employment, and labour;
c) governance: health, safety, stakeholders, transparency, consumers, compliance, risk management, sustainable development,
ethics, and corporate governance.
• Although the results should be considered with caution, environmental, risk management, and stakeholders show significantly

different incidences in the two samples. In the remaining situations,
the differences appear to be variations with no particular
significance.
The results show a core composed of twenty keywords commonly
used in both samples of articles and with no significant differences between them, with minor exceptions. The idea that multinationals may
have actions that are more oriented towards ESG, and sustainable
development does not seem to be confirmed, the results of this analysis
do not demonstrate this greater orientation.
To further develop the analysis, the 195 terms used in this study as
Keywords, defined from the OECD Guidelines (OECD, 2011), were
grouped into three sets: HR (Human Resources) Environment and
General. A dictionary was thus created with these 195 words distributed
by the 3 categories mentioned. With this dictionary, the study was
conducted in MaxQDA "Content analysis based on dictionaries". The
following table (Table 4) shows the results obtained for the two samples
(see Table 5).
Table 4 highlights six articles, with incidences (usages) of the terms
higher than normal (overview). The titles of the six articles are listed
below:
• Ghobakhloo (2020) - Industry 4.0, digitization, and opportunities for
sustainability;
• Kamble et al. (2018) - Sustainable Industry 4.0 framework: A systematic literature review identifying the current trends and future
perspectives;
• Luthra and Mangla (2018) - Evaluating challenges to Industry 4.0
initiatives for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies;
• Fareri et al. (2020) - Estimating Industry 4.0 impact on job profiles
and skills using text mining;
• Galvan ´ et al. (2022) - What skills predict an intern’s ability to
innovate new products? A quantitative study of innovation capability of Mexican college interns;
• Telukdarie et al. (2018) - Industry 4.0 implementation for
multinationals.
A closer look at the contents of these articles leads to the conclusion
that all of them do indeed address issues related to ESG themes. Note
that in each of the samples three articles were identified, although with
nuances (more articles about HR in the Multinationals sample; and more
articles about environmental issues, always accompanied by a strong
incidence of themes from the General category, in the most cited articles
sample). The data thus does not allow us to consider that the literature
on multinationals addresses ESG issues in a more incisive way when
compared to the general literature (sample of the most cited articles) on
I4.0.
4.1. Scientific production evolution
With reference to the descriptive analysis of the SLR, and focusing on
Scopus, a list of 9532 articles is obtained when performing the search,
restricted only to the fields, title, abstract and keywords and restricted
only to documents published in journals, with the string "Industry 4.0"
AND Multinational). The first articles date from 2013 and the last ones,
are already registered in 2023. After very strong growth in 2014, in the
following six years the number of publications grew annually by between 150% and 250% (including). However, in the last two years there
has been a slowdown in growth. The following table shows the above
data.
The evolution of the articles in the two samples shows a greater
seniority in the I4.0 sample, expected because they are the most cited
articles, and a more recent take-off of the topic of multinationals in the
context of I4.0, also expected because it is a more specific topic and as
such more susceptible to later developments.
4.2. Main publications
As far as the main publications are concerned, they can be divided
into three main groups:
• Publications of a multidisciplinary nature (interestingly the three
journals with the most articles are Sustainability (Switzerland),
Applied Sciences (Switzerland), and IEEE Access);
• Publications related to technologies and the production process
(ZWF Zeitschrift Fuer Wirtschaftlichen Fabrikbetrieb, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, International Journal of Advanced
Manufacturing Technology, Sensors, International Journal of Production Research, Computers in Industry, Computers and Industrial
Engineering, and Sensors (Switzerland), and Energies; and
• A technological development analysis publication on the impacts of
technology on society (Technological Forecasting and Social
Change).
The following table (Table 6) shows the overall list of sources with
the most publications (see Table 7).
The two samples of articles considered together present 9 sources
where more than one article was published (see Table 6). Five of the
sources mentioned are also listed in the previous table. However, four
others are only sources of these two samples, they are the International
Journal of Production Economics, the Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, and
Total Quality Management and Business Excellence. As can be seen,
these are publications that can easily be included in the subgroup
identified above of publications linked to technologies and the

production process.
We can thus say that the core of publications listed in Table 6 constitutes the benchmark of sources on the subject and that the subsamples analyzed do not introduce new evidence. We can thus say
that, besides a core of multidisciplinary publications, the theme has been
addressed, mostly in publications linked to technologies and the production process.

4.3. Geographic origin
The production of articles on I4.0 (total of 9532 articles) is very
diverse geographically, more than half of the countries - 126 effectively -
had researchers involved in the articles published on the topic. The
country from which the most articles originated was Germany, followed
by Italy and India (see Table 8, and consider the ORDER column) (see
Table 9).
In the table below, in the GLOBAL column is the number of articles
published with researchers from the indicated country. The total number of contributions adds up to 13,945, higher than the number of articles, because of many articles being published by multinational teams.
The I4.0 and MultiNat columns show the contributions per country
respectively in the sample of the most published articles (I4.0) and in the
sample of articles that address the topic of multinationals (MultiNat).
Seven countries appear in top positions in the global list and in the
two samples: Germany, United Kingdom, Brazil, United States, India,
Portugal, and Canada (ordered by number of contributions in both
samples). Fourteen other countries have also contributed positions to
only one of the samples. They are Italy, France, China, Spain, South
Africa, Denmark, Poland, New Zealand, Austria, Hungary, Iran,
Malaysia, Mexico, and Slovakia. Except for Denmark, New Zealand, and
Iran, all the others are in the top quartile of contributing countries.
Within this group of countries (21 in total), Europe is clearly dominant with 11 contributions (in the previous table, the rightmost column
has the continent coded as indicated in the table below). The American
continent and Asia account for four contributions each, while the other
two continents - Africa and Oceania - have one contribution each. We
can therefore conclude that the interest in the subject is universal. It
should be noted, however, that in the sample of articles on multinationals the distribution by regions changes slightly, although with some
significance since there are no contributions from Oceania.
5. Discussion and conclusions
The characterization made of the two samples of articles and the
global collection of publications on I4.0 shows us three sets of articles
with a significant group of common characteristics:
• As shown in Fig. 3, the articles are relatively recent, from the last
decade, being the most cited articles older and the articles specialized in the multinational topic more recent. This situation was expected as the most cited articles always tend to be slightly older
articles and articles specialized in a given topic to be more recent in
relation to the general development of the topic;
• The articles were mainly in multidisciplinary publications or publications related to technologies and the production process and as
shown before, from a wide range of journals (Fig. 6);
• Europe dominates the production of studies, although scientific
production covers all regions. A set of seven countries - Brazil,
Canada, Germany, India, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the
United States - can also be identified as being present in the three
groups of articles.
As Kolk et al. (2017) state, multinationals can play an important role
in the implementation of sustainable development goals. It would
therefore be expected that the literature on I4.0, which also analyses the
role of multinationals, would highlight the approach to issues related to
sustainable development. It was therefore also expected that there
would be a greater presence of sustainability-related terms in the sample
of articles on multinationals compared to the sample of most cited articles, however, this is not the case. Strictly speaking, the opposite is
true: the sample of most frequently cited articles uses a broader lexicon
of keywords related to ESG topics, although it should be noted that this
extra group of terms is used less frequently.
I4.0 seeks solutions that are technologically efficient and sustainable
(Kagermann et al., 2013), looking for to add value in the three aspects
(Gerlitz, 2015), and creating new business models (Prause, 2015). The
transformations associated with I4.0 in terms of business changes will
contribute to the SDG goals in particular with regard to
manufacturing-economic development (Ghobakhloo, 2020) and in this
way bring to the discussion and reinforce the importance of circular
economy (3R) issues (Bressanelli et al., 2018; Dantas et al., 2021; Dev
et al., 2020; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018; Nascimento et al.,
2019; Rajput and Singh, 2019; Rosa et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2018;
Yadav et al., 2020).
In the core of the most used terms, which in general terms, coincides
in both samples, we find that of the three ESG dimensions, that is, the

environment (environmental; environmental protection, recycling,
resource efficiency, natural resources, and environmental performance);
the social (employees, training; skill, workers, employment, and labour)
and the governance (health, safety, stakeholders, transparency, consumers, compliance, risk management, sustainable development, ethics,
and corporate governance), none of them is standing out in a significant
way.
The study identified a set of articles that unequivocally address issues
related to the environment and to social issues. These articles are equally
distributed between the two samples considered, with no predominance
of articles that address the role of multinational companies. The presence of these articles seems, however, not very significant.
In summary, the study allows us to state with some certainty that:
1. Environmental and social themes are present in the literature about
I4.0 (environmental, training, and workers, are used in more than
half of the articles, in both samples). However, the study also seems
to show that those themes have little centrality in the discussions
about I4.0 (a relatively small number of articles were identified with
those themes as core subjects), that is, although the social and
environmental dimensions are present in the discussion of I4.0, they
have not (had), so far, centrality;
2. When comparing the works published in general terms (sample of the
most cited articles) and in articles that address the role of multinational companies, we do not observe evidence that environmental
and social issues are more addressed in the latter (multinationals)
when compared to the former (most cited articles). This is because
the literature mentions that multinationals would be more sensitive
to these themes, the fact that no differences are observed is nonetheless significant.
5.1. Theoretical and practical implications
Often, approaches to I4.0 are technical in nature (Matt et al., 2020).
This situation occurs both in academia (e.g.: “With the arrival of I4.0,
the overall transformation using digital integration and intelligent engineering has taken a giant leap towards futuristic technology” (Muhuri
et al., 2019, p.218) and among the practitioners (e.g.: “The fourth industrial marriage of physical assets and advanced technologies known as
I4.0, refers to the Revolution, also digital technologies” (Deloitte, 2020,
p.3).
However, as Lamola (2021) reminds us in the introduction to a
special issue devoted to I4.0 in Africa that we can (should?) also look at
technological progress from approaches based on historically-culturally
and socially embedded perspectives. Corroborating this perspective,
Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2019) show that the energy transition associated
with industrial revolutions is also associated with a social revolution.
What our study shows is that this social dimension, and also the
environmental dimension, to which the mentioned literature attributes
importance, is central in the articles we analyzed. From a theoretical
point of view, definitions of I4.0 such as the one by Muhuri et al. (2019),
mentioned above, could (should?) evolve into something like « With the
arrival of I4.0, the overall transformation using digital integration and
intelligent engineering has taken a giant leap towards futuristic technology», with important and significant social and environmental
changes, intrinsic to these transformations (in bold, this paper
contribution).
This integration of the social and environmental dimensions into the
core of I4.0, an intrinsic feature of it, is probably even more relevant in
the practice of businesses. If the digital transition creates skills shortages
and poses difficulties for companies (Birkel et al., 2019), it can also
provide solutions to these difficulties (see, for example, Gorecky et al.,
2017; Roldan ´ et al., 2019). The same rationale can be had regarding risk
assessment (environmental, but also occupational health, see in this
regard Lemos et al., 2022b; Lemos et al., 2022a).
We believe that this process of integrating social and environmental
dimensions into the core of I4.0 will occur more easily if academia and
practitioners address it jointly. In this process, multinationals can play a
relevant, leading, and groundbreaking role, a role that, according to this
study, they have not taken on so far.
On the other hand, the literature frequently tends to emphasize the
role of multinationals as organizations with more sophisticated management models (Alvaro-Moya ´ et al., 2020), considering that they play a
significant part in spreading these more advanced management practices through knowledge transfer processes (Dusanjh and Sidhu, 2009).
Doeringer et al. (2003) demonstrate that this transfer of best management practices happens even in the case of multinational companies
from developed countries setting up their operations in other developed
countries. Ekhart & Breese (2023) demonstrate that this issue is relevant
when developing public strategies to draw in foreign direct investment.
Originally, we know, the literature states that multinational corporations should pay more attention to the social and environmental aspects of the organizations’ activity, given that they constitute a more
advanced management practice. In other words, large corporations of
today are multinationals with activities around the globe and they have
power to concurrently alter the economies and societies of the several
nations in which they are present. The revolutionary issue of our time -
sustainable development – is assumed to be met with their help. This
idea is the foundation of programs like the UN Global Compact and the
OECD Guidelines.
Our study did not, however, support this circumstance. This study
shows that multinational corporations do not appear to be particularly
noteworthy when it comes to constructing the sustainable development
pillar required to realize I4.0’s transformational potential. Does this
prevent that transformative potential from being realized? We might be
inclined to say yes if we were to consider the history. The danger would
be that we would construct a "lame porch" rather than a leveraged one.
Therefore, if we revisit our conceptual framework (see Fig. 2), we will
argue that I4.0 contributes to the sustainability agenda more than
multinationals, at least, according to literature.
This raises the question as to why this might happen and what causes
multinationals to lag in the sustainable development transition journey.
Arguably, multinationals have the resources and capabilities to drive the
sustainable development change, however, the failure of multinationals
to deal with the climate crisis so far questions the credibility of these
institutions, as Andrew Dearing very interestingly points out in the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Dearing (2000)
also explains that it is the SMEs that often have vibrant and stretched
imagination to implement something new. Therefore, we believe that
multinationals might possess the required investment and resources, but
it is only in collaboration with SMEs, who are usually limited by the lack
of similar resources, that will drive the sustainable development transition. In fact, it is possible to say that the large size of multinationals can
hold them back in the rapid and disruptive changes of I4.0. This is
because large companies can be associated with rigid structure, and as a
result that they are slow or less adaptable to change and innovations of
I4.0, or they might perceive new technology as threat to their current
operations. This could explain why multinationals are not highlighted as
major change makers in the literature, whereas I4.0 tools are clearly
associated with the environmental and social transformations. With
regard to the transfer of best management practices from multinational
corporations to businesses in host countries, we can therefore conclude
that the study presents fresh challenges to the theoretical reference
frameworks about I4.0 and the significance of environmental and social
issues in it.
6. Limitations
This study adopted a SLR approach together with a content analysis;
however, this methodology and the research outcomes could be further
developed to overcome some of its limitations.
J. Dias Lopes et al. 
Journal of Cleaner Production 413 (2023) 137381

First, we sought to assess the importance of the two themes under
study - environmental and social - based on their presence in the literature (in research) about I4.0. The list of terms we have used in the
search constitutes a limitation of the work, and perhaps introduces some
barriers as to which concepts have been investigated. However, it should
be noted that it was obtained from a reference document (OECD, 2011)
and that the study results themselves give it some credibility. Nonetheless, we understand that the categorization of 195 keywords into 3
categories could be subject to biases and different interpretation.
Therefore, to address this limitation, it is important to further investigate our keywords and concepts and perhaps additional or different
combination of keywords and groups to see if the outcomes differ. For
example, we suggest conducting an analysis in a reverse manner and
using a different reliable reference point. For example, the two body of
literature could be analyzed using the Sustainable Development Goals
Framework (SDG) as a reference point, which defines 17 goals as an
urgent call for action towards a more sustainable future. It could be
interesting to analyze the SDG keywords and see their relevance in the
multinational and I4.0 literature (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).
Second, the way the literature analysis was carried out, and the
specific use of two tests available in MAXQDA also limits the work. The
conclusion of systematic review and the content analysis resulting from
the researchers reading the full text of the articles was an alternative,
which has been tested in similar studies. The characteristics of the
literature - wide in I4.0, being propitious therefore to the establishment
of reference samples, but relatively small in the subject under study
(multinationals) and relatively homogeneous in temporal terms -
seemed conducive to the use of the referred tests.
Third, it seems clear from this research that environmental and social
issues justify a greater research effort within the scope of I4.0 studies. If
it is true that these themes assume increased importance in multinationals, then this research effort is even more justified, and it is therefore
suggested that research agendas on environmental and social issues be
established within the scope of I4.0 and that special attention be paid to
not only to multinational companies when defining these agendas but
also to other players, such as SMEs. These agendas can either be
confined solely to environmental and social issues, which evidently requires further investigation (de Lange et al., 2012; Schekulin, 2011), or
they can be addressed within broader discussions on sustainability or the
circular economy, as a promising solution (Ly, 2021).
7. Future research
In addition, we put forward recommendations and a few propositions
for future research avenues, which are driven by the findings and the
gaps in the study.
7.1. Methods
First, this research warrants to further investigate the emergence of
the topics in practical settings through qualitative primary data collection across global supply chains. For example, interviews or focus groups
with stakeholders, such as different organizations and businesses along a
multinational supply chain, including government and legislative entities, would be methodological alternatives, possibly more direct to
study this phenomenon. The qualitative methods would enrich the
findings of this study, by providing a deeper understanding into the
experiences and realities of stakeholders along a selected supply chain.
Their knowledge and experience can inform the sustainability journey
and how I4.0 tools are implemented as well as it would further explain
or highlight some of the gaps identified in this research (Silverman,
2017). From the methodological perspectives and given the lengthy
process of planning and implementation of any sustainability initiatives,
understanding the sustainable development phenomenon and the role of
multinational and I4.0 could benefit from adopting a longitudinal study
to understand the long-term effect of such initiatives. For example, we
suggest that it would be interesting to conduct a longitudinal study on
international new ventures and perhaps SMEs who mimic multinationals, to be able to analyze the long-term effects and trajectory of
sustainable development and how these new ventures adopt SDGs into
their strategies, as an example, de Jesus and Mendonça (2018).
Regarding the role of I4.0 and multinationals, a longitudinal study
would allow to analyze the continuous or exponential change in the
global value chain structure and potential inertia in the system that
would only emerge, become visible and understood in the long-term.
7.2. Context
Another aspect to consider, which is driven by the global and
multinational presence, is the role of institutions and cultural context,
such as the implementation of sustainable development initiatives in
emerging economies. Developing countries have a great impact on
future sustainable development initiatives, however this area of
research is still understudied in literature. Nonetheless, the phenomenon
is supposedly susceptible to many different context and institutional
rules and cultural conventions. This would introduce potential complexities and tensions in global supply chains as well as the role and
influence of policies and regulations in the different regions. Therefore,
it is important to investigate opportunities and challenges in the reality
of emerging economies, to advance the knowledge on how multinationals can address issues related to biodiversity loss, climate change,
resource degradations, accompanied with legislation and best practice
cases (Gunasekaran et al., 2014). Accordingly, we propose to study the
sustainable development phenomenon, driven by multinationals and
I4.0, in different contextual and institutional settings, such as emerging
and developed countries. In addition to comparing emerging and
developed countries, another perspective that could bring light to differences in the multinational arena could be to analyze some global
firms and some regional firms (Rugman and Verbeke, 2004). This could
provide a better understanding of how multinationals contribute to the
sustainable development game in each setting, how they influence
institutional change and what the critical enablers and hindering effect
are (similar to the study of Parida et al., 2021).
7.3. Technology
Last, this paper investigated the role of multinationals and found that
key terms and concepts are not majorly found in multinational literature, but the focus is more on I4.0 technology and technological innovation. Therefore, a future research project could investigate what tools
and how they can contribute to the sustainable development agenda
(Sangwan and Bhatia, 2020). Although this research found evidence of
big data analytics (Gholami et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2017) and 3D
printing (Makris et al., 2019; Sartal et al., 2019), the I4.0 framework can
be extended further and to different aspects of a global value chain.
Future research could investigate the role of blockchains in supporting
legislative initiatives or cloud computing and data solutions in logistics
processes. In addition, it could also be interesting to conduct a
comparative study to analyze the differences between emerging and
developed countries as this could help to better understand which specific I4.0 tools are relevant and more adopted in terms of value creation
in each context and how certain sustainability goals are perceived and
targeted by different countries and thus institutional contexts.
