Hurisso et al. (2016) compared permanganate-oxidizable carbon (POXC) and mineralizable carbon (MC)
as indicators for assessing organic matter stabilization and mineralization in soils. The authors found that
POXC and MC provide complementary information about soil organic matter dynamics. They suggested
that combining these two indicators can enhance the understanding of carbon cycling in soils. This
research contributes to the development of improved methods for assessing soil organic matter (Hurisso
et al., 2016).

## Determination of Diffusion Coefficients Using Impedance Spectroscopy Data

provides a valuable tool for characterizing mass transport in electrochemical processes (Nguyen &
Breitkopf, 2018).

## Tool for Tortuosity Estimation in Lithium Ion Battery Porous Electrodes

Ebner and Wood (2015) developed a tool for tortuosity estimation in lithium-ion battery porous electrodes.
The authors introduced a computational approach that utilizes X-ray computed tomography (CT) data
to quantify the tortuosity of electrode materials. They demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of their
tool in estimating tortuosity values. This research contributes to the understanding and optimization of
electrode structures in lithium-ion batteries (Ebner & Wood, 2015).

## Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering

Qu et al. (2020) investigated open-retrieval conversational question answering. The authors proposed a
method that combines open-domain question answering and conversation modeling to generate informative and contextually relevant responses. They conducted experiments on a conversational question
answering dataset and achieved promising results. This research advances the field of conversational
question answering systems (Qu et al., 2020).

insights into the mechanisms of film formation and highlighted the importance of understanding corrosion
processes for the development of corrosion-resistant materials (Unocic et al., 2014).

## Observation of Lithium Dendrites at Ambient Temperature and Below

Love, Baturina, and Swider-Lyons (2014) observed the formation of lithium dendrites at ambient temperature and below. The authors used in situ electrochemical microscopy to study the growth of dendritic
structures in lithium batteries. They found that the growth of lithium dendrites can lead to safety hazards
and reduced battery performance. This research contributes to the understanding of dendrite formation
and the development of strategies to mitigate their negative effects (Love et al., 2014).

## Inkjet Printed Conductive Tracks for Printed Electronics
