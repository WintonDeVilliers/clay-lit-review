ABSTRACT
The exponentially growing literature on Industry 4.0 technologies and their implications for supply chains exhibits valuable insights alongside considerable fragmentation. While prior systematic literature reviews (SLRs)
started to consolidate the literature, an SLR that simultaneously (a) covers several core technologies of the Industry 4.0, (b) synthesizes their positive and negative implications for supply chain performance in a broad
sense, and (c) accounts for the critical success factors that foster or impede these implications is still missing. We
contribute to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge by conducting such an SLR. We synthesize 221 articles published on 11 Industry 4.0 technologies between 2005 and 2021. Rather than aggregate implications,
our SLR presents the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of each core technology vis-a-vis ` supply
chain performance individually. We integrate our findings into a framework of Industry 4.0 supply chain performance and derive promising avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the
challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies
of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as
well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.
1. Introduction
The significance of digitalization, defined as the application of digital
technologies (Palmi´e, Mieh´e, Oghazi, Parida, & Wincent, 2022; Ritter &
Pedersen, 2020), has been equated with the significance of mechanization, electrification, and information technologies – the previous industrial revolutions – earning digitalization the designation of “the
fourth industrial revolution” (Frederico, 2018; Ghobakhloo, 2018).1
Digitalization affords fundamental changes in intra- and interorganizational processes, with its value-creation potential estimated to
exceed 100 trillion USD by 2025 (Hahn, 2020; Palmi´e et al., 2022).
Many of the most valuable companies today have entered the resulting
“Industry 4.0”, relying heavily on advanced digital technologies in their
business models and supply chains (Büyükozkan ¨ & Goçer, ¨ 2018; Choi,
Wen, Sun, & Chung, 2019). According to several scholars (e.g., Gebauer
et al., 2020; Kohtamaki, ¨ Parida, Oghazi, Gebauer, & Baines, 2019), Industry 4.0 technologies hold the key to reaping the benefits of digital
servitization, defined as the “transformation in processes, capabilities,
and offerings within industrial firms and their associate ecosystems to
progressively create, deliver, and capture increased service value arising
from a broad range of enabling digital technologies” (Sjodin, ¨ Parida,
Palmi´e, & Wincent, 2021, p. 574). Some of the main challenges associated with digital servitization are rooted in external relationships and
frictions between firms (Khanra, Dhir, Parida, & Kohtamaki, ¨ 2021;

Porter & Heppelmann, 2014; Rabetino, Kohtam¨
aki, Brax and Sihvonen,
2021). Industry 4.0 technologies can help firms master these challenges
because they support the realization of interorganizational logics,
improve the management of supply chains, and reshape interorganizational processes (Huikkola, Rabetino, Kohtamaki, ¨ & Gebauer, 2020;
Kohtamaki, ¨ Rabetino, Einola, Parida, & Patel, 2021). Studying the influence of Industry 4.0 technologies on supply chains is, therefore,
particularly important (Palmi´e et al., 2022; Porter & Heppelmann,
2014).
Over recent years, research on Industry 4.0 technologies and their
implications for supply chains have grown exponentially, producing
many meaningful insights but also causing a fragmentation of the
literature and a blurring of what we know and do not know (Büyükozkan ¨
& Goçer, ¨ 2018; Hahn, 2020). Existing studies display two tendencies
that impede the emergence of a comprehensive and well-balanced understanding. First, a widespread inclination to focus on the potential
benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies, while bypassing their downsides
and critical success factors (e.g., Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021; Pfohl,
Yahsi, & Kurnaz, 2015). Second, a prevalent propensity to examine only
one or a few of these technologies in a given research project, although
the Industry 4.0 comprises a broad variety of technologies. Indeed, it
remains unclear to what extent insights from one technology can be
generalized to other technologies (e.g., Frederico, Garza-Reyes, Anosike,
& Kumar, 2019; Krykavskyy, Pokhylchenko, & Hayvanovych, 2019).
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have started to consolidate our
body of knowledge on the implications of Industry 4.0 technologies for
supply chains. Prior SLRs in this domain have focused on individual
technologies (e.g., mobile technologies [Barata, Da Cunha, & Stal,
2018]), supply chains in specific industries (e.g., pharma [Ding, 2018]),
and specific aspects of supply chains (e.g., their environmental performance [Yadav, Luthra, Jakhar, Mangla, & Rai, 2020], control issues
[Ivanov, Sethi, Dolgui, & Sokolov, 2018], and proximity to partners
[Dallasega, Rauch, & Linder, 2018]). Still missing is an SLR that
simultaneously (a) covers several core technologies of the Industry 4.0,
(b) synthesizes their positive and negative implications for supply chain
performance in a broader sense, and (c) accounts for the critical success
factors that maximize positive or minimize negative implications.
Our study supports the emergence of a more comprehensive and
better-balanced understanding of the Industry 4.0 and supply chains by
producing an extensive SLR with these characteristics. Conducting an
extensive review of the pertinent literature, our study covers 221 articles
published between 2005 and 2021 to address two research questions:
(RQ1) What benefits and challenges do the core technologies of the
Industry 4.0 bring to supply chain performance? (RQ2) Which critical
success factors regulate the realization of these benefits and challenges?
Our SLR provides answers to these research questions for 11 core
technologies of the Industry 4.0 – namely, the Internet of People, the
Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data technologies, blockchain,
augmented reality, automation, robotics, additive manufacturing, simulation,
and semantic technologies. Our principal intention is not to answer these
questions at the level of the Industry 4.0 as a whole. Rather, it is directed
at the technology level, describing benefits, challenges, and critical
success factors for each core technology individually. We develop a
framework that integrates the influence of the 11 core technologies,
their benefits, challenges, and critical success factors on supply chain
performance. This framework provides a foundation and a structural
perspective to discuss supply chains in the fourth industrial revolution
(e.g., Barata, 2021; Meindl, Ayala, Mendonça, & Frank, 2021) and to
map core technologies of the Industry 4.0 as well as their benefits,
challenges, and critical success factors (e.g., Fatorachian & Kazemi,
2021; Sony, Antony, Mc Dermott, & Garza-Reyes, 2021).
2. Method
Our study follows the established five-step process of conducting
SLRs described by Denyer and Tranfield (2009) and illustrated in Fig. 1.
First, we conducted an exploratory literature review with respect to
Industry 4.0 technologies and supply chains to collate key technology
characteristics (e.g., Büyükozkan ¨ & Goçer, ¨ 2018; Frederico, 2018;
Ghobakhloo, 2018; Schwab & Davis, 2018) and supply chain components integrated into these technologies (Akkermans, Bogerd, Yücesan,
& Van Wassenhove, 2003; Smith & Reece, 1999).
Second, we based the studies for our SLR on two databases, Web of
Science (WoS) and Business Source Premier (BSP). To identify potentially relevant articles in both databases, we used Boolean logic to
combine the search term “supply chain” with various search terms
referring to Industry 4.0. Specifically, we applied the following search
string for English language journal articles (cf. Keupp, Palmi´e, & Gassmann, 2012):
((“supply chain”) AND (“industry 4.0” OR “digit*” OR “cyber-physical
systems” OR “fourth industrial revolution”))
In the WoS, we restricted our search to the following domains:
Management, Engineering, Transportation, Business, Economics, Computer Science, Operations Research, Management Science, Telecommunications, Remote Sensing, Automation Control Systems, Law,
Robotics, and Social Issues. We did not restrict the search in either
database to a specific period in time. Our review includes articles published before October/November 2021. These search criteria resulted in
1440 hits in WoS and 122 hits in BSP. Fifty-two duplicate hits occurring
in both databases were excluded, yielding 1510 unique studies. To
evaluate the likelihood of missing relevant articles, we reran the above
search string in Scopus in April 2022, looking for English language articles from the “business, management and accounting” domain that
feature the search terms in the title, abstract, author-supplied keywords,
and/or standardized index terms. Scopus returned 1079 document results. Since 1079 is fewer than 1510, the likelihood of missing a
considerable share of relevant articles is low.
Third, we read the 1510 abstracts resulting from step 2 to check
whether these hits met additional criteria. Our starting point for the
identification of Industry 4.0 core technologies were BCG’s (2015) “Nine
Pillars” of the Industry 4.0, which have been previously utilized in academic research (e.g., Vaidya, Ambad, & Bhosle, 2018). As two of these
nine pillars (“cybersecurity” and “horizontal and vertical system integration”) describe aims and principles rather than specific technologies,
Fig. 1. Systematic review process.
F.F. Rad et al. 
Industrial Marketing Management 105 (2022) 268–293
270
we replaced these two pillars with associated technologies. For cybersecurity, we used “blockchain” as an enabling technology. To depict
horizontal and vertical system integration, we used “automation”,
“internet of people”, and “semantic technologies”. Semantic technologies support system integration because “semantic technologies [can be
used] to achieve interoperability among heterogeneous IoT systems”
(Patel, Ali, & Sheth, 2018, p. 85). Including three additional technologies to represent one of the original nine pillars resulted in a list of 11
core technologies: The Internet of People (IoP) (Ghobakhloo, 2018), the
Internet of Things (IoT) (Boyes, Hallaq, Cunningham, & Watson, 2018;
Frederico, 2018; Schwab & Davis, 2018), cloud computing (CC) (Stergiou, Psannis, Kim, & Gupta, 2018), big data technologies (BDTs)
(Frederico, 2018; Ghobakhloo, 2018), blockchain (BC) (Schwab &
Davis, 2018), augmented reality (AR) (Yew, Ong, & Nee, 2016), automation (AU) (Frederico, 2018; Lu, 2017), robotics (RO) (Schwab &
Davis, 2018), additive manufacturing (AM) (Mellor, Hao, & Zhang,
2014; Schwab & Davis, 2018), simulation (SI) (Xu et al., 2016), and
semantic technologies (STs) (Ghobakhloo, 2018). The 11 core technologies are briefly described in Table 1.
Search hits that did not include one or more of these core technologies were dropped. Moreover, articles returned by the search engines
were only retained for the subsequent steps if their abstract suggested
that the respective article deals at least moderately with the Industry 4.0
and/or its core technologies in the context of supply chains, which are
defined as networks of two or more independent actors (e.g., suppliers,
customers, and logistics service providers). Applying these criteria to the
1510 abstracts reduced the number of articles to 283 (256 files from
WoS and 27 additional, unique files from BSP).
We then read the full text of these 283 documents to determine
whether the articles actually dealt with the Industry 4.0 and/or its core
technologies in the context of supply chains to a significant extent. This
analysis led to the exclusion of a further 62 documents. The remaining
221 documents represent the final set of articles synthesized in our SLR.
Fig. 2 outlines the selection process of articles from the two databases.
Fourth, we developed a data coding form to extract the necessary
information to answer our research questions (Tranfield, Denyer, &
Smart, 2003). At least two researchers coded each study to minimize the
risk of coding errors and misinterpretations (Denyer & Tranfield, 2009).
We then performed a thematic analysis and subsequent synthesis to
derive the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors associated
with the 11 Industry 4.0 core technologies in the supply-chain context
(Cerchione & Esposito, 2016; Tranfield et al., 2003). Fifth, we used the
results from the thematic analysis and subsequent synthesis to portray
the current state of knowledge, develop a framework, and propose
future research directions. Our findings are presented next.
3. Findings
3.1. Descriptive account of the 221 articles in our SLR
Before we synthesize the benefits, challenges, and critical success
factors of Industry 4.0 technologies regarding supply chain performance, we provide a descriptive account of the 221 reviewed articles.2
Fig. 3 reveals a substantial increase in the number of relevant
articles published over time, especially after 2017. Moreover, Fig. 3
shows that the technologies at the core of the Industry 4.0 had already
been studied in a supply-chain context for several years before the term
“Industry 4.0” was first used at the Hanover Trade Fair in 2011 (Frederico, 2018; Ghobakhloo, 2018). Interest during the early years centered
on technologies such as SI and the IoT around RFID (e.g., Chen, Fan, &
Chen, 2009; Gessner, Volonino, & Fish, 2007).
Table 2 shows that the International Journal of Production Research
has published, by far, the most articles in our sample – 21 out of the 221

Additive
manufacturing
(AM)
In contrast to subtractive
manufacturing, additive
manufacturing and production
are characterized by joining the
materials layer upon layer, with
the purpose of creating physical
output from a 3D model. AM
disrupts the conventional
subtractive manufacturing and
production system, including
logistics, shipping,
transportation, infrastructure,
and retail. In this paper, we
focus on both 3D modelling and
3D printing.

Augmented reality
(AR)
Technology through which
computer graphics are
superimposed on the real
environment, allowing
improved visualization and
views of various environments
within supply chains, such as
physical stores.
(Gustafsson et al., 2019;
Yew et al., 2016)
Automation (AU) Technologies that provide a
network of self-conducting
activities and processes. In this
paper, automation is mainly
grounded in predictable
conditions and centered on
repetitive tasks.

Big data
technologies
(BDTs)
Technologies that enable the
capture, manipulation, and
analysis of large, diversified
amounts of data (throughout the
supply chain) for the purpose of
creating knowledge and
information.
(Frederico, 2018;
Ghobakhloo, 2018)
Blockchain (BC) It is a distributed ledger
technology platform that can
store and exchange digital
content (e.g., information and
transactions) among
participants (including the
supply chain actors), without
requiring a centralized party.
(Schwab & Davis, 2018;
Van Hoek, Fugate,
Davletshin, & Waller,
2019)
Cloud computing
(CC)
Technologies that enable shared
data storage, computation,
applications, and services on the
cloud, for businesses and supply
chains.
(Jede & Teuteberg, 2015;
Stergiou et al., 2018)
Internet of People
(IoP)
Technology that targets the
relationship between users of
online platforms and supply
chain actors. Through IoP, user
information can be gathered
from online platforms for
business purposes.
(Ghobakhloo, 2018)
Internet of Things
(IoT)
A network of physical objects is
embedded with technologies,
such as sensors, to produce,
process, and exchange data.
Physical objects can range from
consumer products to
production equipment and
transportation vehicles,
throughout the supply chain. In
this paper, industrial IoT is
considered a subset of IoT.

articles (9.5%). Other prominent journals in decreasing order are: Production Planning & Control (8 articles; 3.6%), the Journal of Cleaner
Production (7 articles; 3.2%), Supply Chain Management: An International
Journal (7 articles; 3.2%), and Sustainability (7 articles; 3.2%). Three
more journals have each published 5 or 6 articles. The remaining 155
articles are distributed across 117 different journals. The dispersion of
papers is indicative of the multi-faceted and multidisciplinary nature of
this topic (cf. Junge, 2019; Krykavskyy et al., 2019).
Fig. 4 illustrates that most studies on the topic have applied empirical
methods. With a share of 57.9% (128 articles), empirical approaches
outnumber all other methods combined. There is, therefore, much
empirical evidence for our SLR to integrate.
Fig. 5 presents the distribution of research interest across the 11 core
technologies that constitute the Industry 4.0. A single paper may address
two or more constituting technologies together (e.g., BC with IoT). The
most heavily discussed core technology is the Internet of Things, which
is featured in 19.3% of the reviewed articles – attracting even more
attention than the Industry 4.0 in general (15.2%). Blockchain (13.7%)
and additive manufacturing (12.4%) are the second and third most
prominent core technologies of the Industry 4.0. In contrast, the Internet
of People (1.3%), semantic technologies (1.5%), and augmented reality

providing a definition before we synthesize its benefits, challenges, and
critical success factors. Finally, we will describe the benefits, challenges,
and critical success factors that have been emphasized for the Industry
4.0 as a whole. Table 3 provides an overview of our respective findings.

as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies” (Frazier, 2014:
p. 1917). This technology provides a precise and transparent understanding of a supply chain’s requirements in terms of materials and information flows for production purposes. This type of precision can
contribute significantly to supply chain performance through, for
example, reduced logistics and inventory costs, and just-in-time production (Baumers et al., 2013; Khajavi et al., 2018; Tziantopoulos,
Tsolakis, Vlachos, & Tsironis, 2019; Verboeket & Krikke, 2019). These
benefits can be summarized as optimized supply chain flows. Moreover,
AM delivers configurable product design and production based on
specificities as well as demands (and, where needed, compatibility with
government requirements). Consequently, customized offerings deliver
an added benefit of AM (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Chan, Griffin, Lim,
Zeng, & Chiu, 2018; Hohn & Durach, 2021). Additionally, precise and
transparent information on the materials required for production and
non-subtractive layer-on-layer manufacturing helps reduce waste of
materials and energy and contributes to environmental sustainability
(Achillas, Aidonis, Iakovou, Thymianidis, & Tzetzis, 2015; Kunovjanek
& Reiner, 2020; Sandvik & Stubbs, 2019). Furthermore, as AM opens up
the space for collaboration among various actors, such as designers and
customers, it can strengthen supply chain integration (Chang, Pan, &
Howard, 2017; Holmstrom, ¨ Liotta, & Chaudhuri, 2017; Verboeket &
Krikke, 2019). Finally, AM can contribute to advancements in R&D. AM
eliminates the need for grounded production lines and reduces the time
to market. A firm can manufacture products in small quantities for
instant placement in the market, obtain customer feedback, make
required changes, and then produce the products in large quantities
(Hohn & Durach, 2021; Lyly-Yrjan¨ ¨
ainen, Holmstrom, ¨ Johansson, &
Suomala, 2016; Verboeket & Krikke, 2019).
However, three-dimensional printing of certain components, a type
of AM, is associated with high costs (e.g., the cost of materials) and time
consumption (e.g., Chekurov, Metsa-Kortelainen, ¨ Salmi, Roda, & Jussila,
2018; Hohn & Durach, 2021; Verboeket & Krikke, 2019). Threedimensional modelling offers plenty of room for collaborative design
and production among multiple supply chain actors. However, coordinating multi-sided design and production efforts can place significant
demands on management (e.g., Arora, Arora, Kumar, & Pant, 2020; Corsini, Aranda-Jan, & Moultrie, 2020; Holmstrom ¨ et al., 2017; Pfouga &
Stjepandi´c, 2018). For example, certain suppliers’ offerings can become
less relevant, whereas other suppliers can become more central in the
production process. Hence, there is an emerging need for supply chain
restructuring, which is rarely easy to accomplish. Occasionally, the
availability of suitable construction materials for three-dimensional
printing can cause supply problems (e.g., Corsini et al., 2020; Verboeket
& Krikke, 2019). Lastly, when customization occurs continuously, wide
variations in a product emerge that can cause complexity issues with the
digital design model (Hohn & Durach, 2021; Holmstrom, ¨ Holweg,
Khajavi, & Partanen, 2016).
The critical success factors that allow firms to realize the benefits and
master the challenges of AM for supply chain performance include a
collaborative and integrated product design for 3D modelling and printing
(e.g., Holmstrom ¨ et al., 2016; Poirier, Forgues, & Staub-French, 2017;
Verboeket & Krikke, 2019). AM is strongly dependent on product
modelling, which often involves different supply chain actors (e.g., designers and suppliers). Hence, supply chains need to develop appropriate strategies for collaborative multi-sided design, in alignment with
the various stakeholders involved. Several scholars (e.g., Chan et al.,
2018; Gupta, Tiwari, Bukkapatnam, & Karri, 2020; Khajavi et al., 2018;
Verboeket & Krikke, 2019) also highlight the need for a well-developed
information platform to process relevant information for optimizing AM.
Furthermore, it may be advisable to implement AM in a gradual, step-bystep manner (Holmstrom ¨ et al., 2016; Holmstrom ¨ et al., 2017). Initially,
it can settle for operational improvement. As a next step, it can move to
tool-based manufacturing replacement, followed by a shift to innovative
practices enabled by discrete three-dimensional printing capabilities
(Holmstrom ¨ et al., 2016). To make full use of three-dimensional printing
options and possibilities, the design software used needs to conform
with the printers’ requirements. For example, not all CAD versions cover
every option offered by three-dimensional printers (Mandolla, Petruzzelli, Percoco, & Urbinati, 2019). In other words, there needs to be
software–printer compliance.
3.2.2. Augmented reality
Augmented reality (AR) is defined as a “real-time direct or indirect
view of a physical real-world environment that has been enhanced/
augmented by adding virtual computer-generated information to it”
(Carmigniani et al., 2011, p. 342). AR facilitates improvements in
customer service. AR tools, such as smart glasses, wearable devices, and
cameras, can improve the efficiency and quality of order picking, routing,
and delivery activities with the support of vision picking, data synchronization, and information retrieval (Agrawal & Narain, 2021).
While the reviewed literature described the benefits of AR, none of
the articles in our SLR pointed to specific challenges that AR pose for
supply chain performance. However, at least one article mentioned a
critical success factor for utilizing AR in supply chains successfully –
Training and new competences (Patrucco, Ciccullo, & Pero, 2020). Firms
should, therefore, consider developing a training strategy and investing
in training efforts to foster the development of additional competencies.

3.2.3. Automation
Automation (AU) can be defined as “the creation and application of
technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of
products and services” (International Society of Automation, 2022). AU
of supply chain processes enables optimization. Automation improves
efficiency, including reductions in labor costs and energy consumption
(Esmaeilian, Sarkis, Lewis, & Behdad, 2020; Gustafsson, Jonsson, &
Holmstrom, ¨ 2019; Moreno, Court, Wright, & Charnley, 2019). AU is
associated with increased self-governance and pace that lead to quality
improvements (Hahn, 2020; Moreno et al., 2019). It reduces human
interventions and errors (Ghadimi, Wang, Lim, & Heavey, 2019; Jagtap
& Rahimifard, 2019; Klumpp & Zijm, 2019) and facilitates supply chain
interoperability as well as integration (Ghadimi et al., 2019; Moreno
et al., 2019).
In terms of downside factors, AU is associated with high investment
requirements and coordination costs (Dolgui et al., 2019; Sanders,
Boone, Ganeshan, & Wood, 2019). Furthermore, AU can create an artificial divide between human workers and automated logistics and supply
chain components (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019), plausibly resulting in suboptimal human–machine cooperation. The critical success factors to
make the most of AU comprise preparation and alignment (Frazzon,
Dutra, & Vianna, 2015; Martín-Gomez, ´ Aguayo-Gonzalez, ´ & Luque,
2019; Roy & Satpathy, 2019). Both business and technology aspects
need to be considered and compatibly understood by the actors
involved. Firms need to determine whether the financial resource allocation fits the business landscape and whether their infrastructure is
sufficiently well developed and fit for the purposes of automation.
3.2.4. Big data technologies
Big data has been defined as data characterized by “high volume,
velocity and variety to require specific technology and analytical
methods for its transformation into value” (De Mauro, Greco, & Grimaldi, 2016, p. 122). Big data technologies (BDTs) provide three main
benefits: awareness and informed decision making, reliability, and information connectivity. BDTs equip supply chain actors with analytical
capability that generates business insights based on a large volume of
real-time data with high velocity and from diversified sources. Such
insights improve decision making across the supply chain in a range of
areas, such as forecasting, risk management, planning, marketing, sustainability, and efficiency (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Jabbour, Fiorini,
Ndubisi, Queiroz, & Piato, 2020; Kache & Seuring, 2017). Furthermore,
as BDTs strengthen the data-driven business decision-making process,
each actor in the supply chain will be expected to make better-informed
decisions, which can strengthen the reliability perceived by other actors
and enhance the overall reliability of the supply chain and the collaboration among actors (Jabbour et al., 2020; Molka-Danielsen, Engelseth,
& Wang, 2018). Finally, BDTs facilitate data sharing and enrich the
information environment across the supply chain, supporting supply
chain connectivity (Brinch, Stentoft, Jensen, & Rajkumar, 2018; Kache
& Seuring, 2017).
The first challenges of BDTs for supply chain performance are related
to infrastructure and human resources. Acquiring the required skillsets
for BDT utilization can be difficult because adequate human resources
are often scarce (Gupta, Kumar, Kusi-Sarpong, Jabbour, & Agyemang,
2020; Weersink, Fraser, Pannell, Duncan, & Rotz, 2018; Zaki, Theodoulidis, Shapira, Neely, & Tepel, 2019). BDTs also require an infrastructure that is well formulated (e.g., control towers and analytics
algorithms), which can mean high costs (Gruˇzauskas, Baskutis, &
Navickas, 2018; Raut et al., 2019; Zaki et al., 2019). Moreover, big data
governance is not a trivial issue (Jabbour et al., 2020; Nguyen, Lamouri,
Pellerin, Tamayo, & Lekens, 2021; Spanaki, Gürgüç, Adams, & Mulligan,
2018). Coordinating BDTs among supply chain actors with diverse
backgrounds (techno-geographical, cultural, and socio-economical) and
differing perceptions can be a challenging task (Gravili, Benvenuto,
Avram, & Viola, 2018; Ivanov, Dolgui, & Sokolov, 2019; Nguyen et al.,
2021). Issues concerning cybersecurity threats and information leakage, as
well as privacy concerns of individuals and customers need to be taken
very seriously (Ivanov et al., 2019; Kache & Seuring, 2017; Nguyen
et al., 2021). Lastly, the accurate measurement of big data’s business value
and its financial return can complicate supply chain relationships if not
handled appropriately (Kache & Seuring, 2017; Weersink et al., 2018).
The critical success factors for the utilization of BDTs and the
exploitation of the resulting insights throughout the supply chain in real
time include integration, both internally (e.g., IT and business departments) and externally with other actors (Kache & Seuring, 2017;
Raut et al., 2019; Spanaki et al., 2018). Furthermore, the analytical
output produced by BDTs needs to be readable, relevant, and capable of
spotting patterns, trends, and outliers (Kache & Seuring, 2017; MolkaDanielsen et al., 2018). To analyze big data, modularization and prioritization can be important. When big data variety is high, the focus may
need to shift to the most critical data (Ding, 2018; Molka-Danielsen
et al., 2018). Moreover, the managerial approach and the leadership style
play important roles in gaining value from BDTs (Raut et al., 2019;
Jabbour et al., 2020; Dolgui, Ivanov, Sethi, & Sokolov, 2019. Since BDTs
are, by nature, centered on information, every related strategy and activity needs to be compatible with information privacy laws enforced by the
government (Raut et al., 2019).
3.2.5. Blockchain (distributed ledger technology)
Blockchain technology “refers to a fully distributed system for
cryptographically capturing and storing a consistent, immutable, linear
event log of transactions between networked actors” (Risius & Spohrer,
2017, p. 386). Using Blockchain (BC) across the supply chain offers a
number of potential benefits: data security; data traceability, transparency;
smart contracting; efficiency; and decentralization. First, BC protects supply chain information by ensuring authenticable and secure data storage
and transmission among actors and by preventing unauthorized data
mutation (Dolgui, Ivanov, Potryasaev, et al., 2019; Kamble et al., 2021;
Sharma, Kumar, & Park, 2018). Second, the history and current status of
materials, transactions, processes, and products throughout the supply
chain are transparent and traceable, which provides various opportunities to ensure standard control and authentication, gain information
on bottlenecks, improve supply chain trust and awareness, and
contribute to green supply chain practices and the emergence of a circular economy (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Sarkis, Kouhizadeh, & Zhu,
2020; Yanovich et al., 2018). Third, BC enables the adoption of smart
contracts among supply chain actors because BC is associated with
certain features (Kamble et al., 2021; Rejeb, Keogh, & Treiblmaier,
2019; Sarkis et al., 2020). BC hashing and cryptographic mechanisms
make it possible to authenticate the identity of actors/parties that are
involved in the contract (Choi et al., 2019; Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis, &
Shen, 2019). Reliable data storage and transmission are also provided,
facilitating the implementation of contract-based business logic and
operations (Choi et al., 2019; Rejeb et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2018). In
addition, BC allows for operational fulfilment control through smart
contracts, based on specific plans, negotiation terms, and policies
(Dolgui, Ivanov, Potryasaev, et al., 2019). BC also supports the automation of contract-related activities, such as payments and insurance
claims (Batwa & Norrman, 2020; Saberi et al., 2019; Sharma et al.,
2018). Fourth, BC contributes to supply chain efficiency and cost
reduction (Dolgui, Ivanov, Potryasaev, et al., 2019; Gromovs & Lammi,
2017; Wang, Wu, Chen, & Evans, 2020). Likewise, dependency on
middlemen can be reduced or eliminated (Choi et al., 2019; Kamble
et al., 2021; Sarkis et al., 2020), and the resulting contractual arrangements and connectivity will lower supply chain transaction costs (Min,
2019; Sarkis et al., 2020).
However, BC is also facing a number of significant challenges. It faces
technical issues due to the low maturity of the technology (Esmaeilian
et al., 2020; Etemadi, Van Gelder, & Strozzi, 2021; Radanovi´c & Liki´c,
2018). Maintaining efficient and consistent interlinkages among BC
shards can be a challenging task (Jabbar, Lloyd, Hammoudeh, Adebisi,
& Raza, 2021; Rejeb et al., 2019). In addition, BC transaction mining can
F.F. Rad et al. 
Industrial Marketing Management 105 (2022) 268–293
279
involve intensive computing power, and adding a single block to an
existing BC can mean enormous energy consumption (Esmaeilian et al.,
2020; Mondal et al., 2019; Sahebi, Masoomi, & Ghorbani, 2020). Thus
far, BC has not demonstrated outstanding results in managing largescale transactions (Esmaeilian et al., 2020; Jabbar et al., 2021; Min,
2019; Sundarakani, Ajaykumar, & Gunasekaran, 2021). Furthermore,
there is a scarcity of human resources with relevant skills and expertise
(Cole, Stevenson, & Aitken, 2019; Jabbar et al., 2021; Mathivathanan,
Mathiyazhagan, Rana, Khorana, & Dwivedi, 2021). Governance can also
be an issue for a supply-chain-wide blockchain. Implementing a BC may
face resistance across the supply chain. There is a need for policies and
approaches to be coordinated, which can be a difficult task (Etemadi
et al., 2021; Jabbar et al., 2021; Saberi et al., 2019; Sobb, Turnbull, &
Moustafa, 2020). Moreover, legal and relational trust issues can arise,
and penalties for deviating from a smart contract can occur (Jabbar
et al., 2021; Sobb et al., 2020; Sundarakani et al., 2021). It may also be
complicated to implement changes in smart contracts when they are
needed because it is difficult to modify the data in the BC (Dolgui, Ivanov, Sethi, & Sokolov, 2019; Etemadi et al., 2021; Sobb et al., 2020).
The critical success factors for the beneficial use of BC in supply
chains include preparation and alignment (Min, 2019; Tezel, Febrero,
Papadonikolaki, & Yitmen, 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Implementing BC
requires a clear understanding of the strategies, needs, and objectives
that the businesses and actors aim to serve. Combining BCs with other
relevant technologies can improve benefits and enhance the features of
BCs (Jabbar et al., 2021; Kohler ¨ & Pizzol, 2020). The involved parties
need to agree on implementation plans and infrastructure designs. In
addition, a strategic approach and the support of top management are
critical for successful blockchain adoption (Min, 2019; Saberi et al.,
2019; Wamba, Queiroz, & Trinchera, 2020).
3.2.6. Cloud computing
The term “cloud computing” (CC) refers to “a model for enabling
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and
services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction” (Dillon, Wu, &
Chang, 2010, p. 27). CC offers the prospect of improved supply chain
integration, on-demand services, scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.
Compared to local servers, a cloud solution facilitates data integration,
delivers faster, more secure, and enhanced information, and supports
service sharing among supply chain actors. Consequently, there is a
beneficial impact on collaboration and process performance (Agrawal &
Narain, 2021; Frank, Dalenogare, & Ayala, 2019; Jede & Teuteberg,
2015). Second, CC enables on-demand services, offering on-demand
cloud solutions (Dolgui, Ivanov, Potryasaev, et al., 2019; Jede & Teuteberg, 2015; Wu, Rosen, Wang, & Schaefer, 2015). Third, cloud solutions can easily be adjusted to different scales based on data
requirements (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Sobb et al., 2020; Sundarakani,
Kamran, Maheshwari, & Jain, 2019). Moreover, such a characteristic
provides flexibility in data management (Hahn, 2020; Jede & Teuteberg,
2015) and reduces the costs of the information environment throughout
the supply chain (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Jede & Teuteberg, 2015;
Sundarakani et al., 2019).
One of the main challenges with CC technologies for supply chains
concerns information gaps (Sundarakani et al., 2021). Communication
among partners may suffer and the information exchanged may become
less rich. Moreover, CC can cause security issues for IoT devices (Sobb
et al., 2020). Regarding critical success factors, the benefits of utilizing
CC on the supply chain level depend on collaborative planning and
alignment, both internally and externally (Jede & Teuteberg, 2015;
Leung et al., 2018; Satit & Somjit, 2017).
3.2.7. Internet of People
The term “Internet of People” (IoP) means that “humans and their
personal devices […] will be active elements of applications, services,
and network functions provisioning [… and that] personal devices
operate in the cyber world as proxies of humans and behave as humans
do in the physical world” (Conti, Passarella, & Das, 2017, p. 9). According to the reviewed literature (Daú, Scavarda, Scavarda, & Portugal,
2019; Oh, Teo, & Sambamurthy, 2012; Stiakakis & Georgiadis, 2011),
IoP benefits the supply chain by improving customer intelligence and
relationship management. Through the IoP, various kinds of data are
constantly generated by users who may be current or future customers of
the supply chain. In this way, businesses utilize the data of users to gain
intelligence regarding their interests, experiences, and opinions on
products and services, and to identify the cause of changes in their
behavior. Businesses can use these insights to create more value for their
customers.
In terms of downside factors, the IoP has increased privacy concerns.
Building customer intelligence through IoP is centered on the accessibility and utilization of users’ data for business purposes. Such a feature
can heighten user concerns about how their data is used, and there is an
elevated risk of users perceiving companies to violate their privacy
(Chang, Wu, & Liao, 2010). In contrast to its potential upsides and
downsides, the reviewed literature does not highlight specific critical
success factors of the fruitful use of the IoP in the supply chain context.
3.2.8. Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as the entirety of “smart,
connected products [which are] made possible by vast improvements in
processing power and device miniaturization and by the network benefits of ubiquitous wireless connectivity” (Porter & Heppelmann, 2014,
p. 66). According to the reviewed literature, the IoT offers a variety of
benefits. The first benefit is performance optimization. The IoT is underpinned by an interlinked ecosystem of “things” at the supply chain level,
through which resource unification and synergy occur within the
interconnected network. Hence, the performance of supply chain processes (e.g., transportation), products, and physical assets (e.g., equipment and systems) can be optimized (Huang, Chen, Sun, Zhang, & Yao,
2020; Li, Palau, & Parlikad, 2018; Rebelo, Pereira, & Queiroz, 2021).
Furthermore, the IoT enables constant data generation, the monitoring
of physical objects (i.e., “things”) throughout the supply chain, and data
access in a defined manner. These characteristics facilitate information
transparency and product traceability – for example, with respect to
consumption patterns, status, composition, physical assets, as well as
processes and activities. Thus, the IoT improves supply chain sustainability and circular economy practices (Mastos et al., 2020; Rebelo et al.,
2021; Teucke, Broda, Boerold, & Freitag, 2018; Yang, Fu, & Zhang,
2021). The third benefit refers to connectivity and integration. As the
IoT creates a network that connects physical objects with one another
and with actors across the supply chain, collaborative business decision
making becomes possible and integration occurs (Bienhaus & Haddud,
2018; De Vass, Shee, & Miah, 2021b; Rebelo et al., 2021). Lastly, the IoT
contributes to supply chain awareness and flexibility. Access to extensive and real-time granular data provides supply chains with enhanced
insight and knowledge on various business facets, leading to betterinformed business decisions and greater flexibility (Agrifoglio, Cannavale, Laurenza, & Metallo, 2017; Hahn, 2020; Rebelo et al., 2021).
The IoT also poses a number of challenges. There is often a struggle
to acquire the required skillset and the technological infrastructure for the
IoT to be utilized throughout the supply chain (De Vass, Shee, & Miah,
2021a; Kamble, Gunasekaran, Parekh, & Joshi, 2019). The IoT requires
significant investment and can be costly to adopt (Buil, Piera, & Laserna,
2011; De Vass et al., 2021a; Sandvik & Stubbs, 2019). Furthermore, as
the IoT generates a large volume of detailed data, it may be challenging
to put adequate coordination and control mechanisms in place (Exposito,
Gay-Fernandez, ´ & Cuinas, 2013; Sobb et al., 2020). Another central
challenge concerns data security and privacy (De Vass et al., 2021a; Rejeb
et al., 2019; Sobb et al., 2020). Supply chain actors may have concerns
about the potential leakage of confidential information, or they may be
anxious about information asymmetry because data storage,
F.F. Rad et al. 
Industrial Marketing Management 105 (2022) 268–293
280
management, and security is centralized and beyond their control as
decentralized actors (Rejeb et al., 2019). Privacy concerns can cause
actors to impose restrictions on data accessibility, which can hinder
supply chains in fully realizing the potential of IoT use (Ding, 2018).
The reviewed literature has also highlighted certain critical success
factors for the fruitful application of the IoT in supply chains. The IoT
requires actors to interconnect their “things”, constructing an underlying foundation that is properly aligned to run the IoT on the supply chain
level (e.g., Bienhaus & Haddud, 2018; Dunke, Heckmann, Nickel, &
Saldanha-da-Gama, 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2019). The
implications of the IoT for conducting business may be so huge that top
management involvement can play an important role in the success of the
IoT on the supply chain level (Ardito, Petruzzelli, Panniello, & Garavelli,
2019; Wang, Chen, & Xie, 2010). Moreover, technologies that enable the
connectivity of physical objects need to be monitored to deliver the expected performance (Huang et al., 2020; Leite, Pinto, & Alves, 2019).
Connected objects might be required to take action proactively without
external intervention. For this purpose, they should be equipped with
components such as actuators (Molka-Danielsen et al., 2018).
3.2.9. Robotics
Robotics (RO) is described as “the generation of computer-controlled
motions of physical objects” (Halperin, Kavraki, & Solovey, 2017, p. 1).
RO provide opportunities for process optimization and connectivity. RO
can optimize the performance of supply chain processes by offering
improvements in, for example, agility, speed, quality, and efficiency
(Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Sanders et al., 2019). Moreover, RO is characterized by communicability based on real-time information. It facilitates connectivity between supply chain actors, processes, and
infrastructure (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Tsolakis, Bechtsis, & Srai,
2019).
A challenge impeding large-scale utilization of robotics is cost. For
instance, the reviewed literature has highlighted the financial resources
needed to embrace intelligent autonomous vehicles in supply chains
(Bechtsis, Tsolakis, Vlachos, & Srai, 2018; Sanders et al., 2019). A critical success factor for the utilization of robotics in supply chains is the
proper definition and development of the required infrastructure. Several
actors may need to agree on the communication infrastructure and other
elements of the technical infrastructure to enable the interoperability of
robotic solutions across the supply chain (Bechtsis et al., 2018).
3.2.10. Semantic technologies
Semantic technologies (STs) are defined as “technical approaches
that facilitate or make use of the interpretation of meaning by machines”
(Fürber, 2016, p. 56). STs can benefit the supply chain by enabling data
linkage and information integration. Throughout the supply chain, a large
volume of data is generated and stored in different formats, languages,
and syntaxes. STs allow relationships to be established between these
varied data and their meanings, facilitating readability and communicability of data for machines, applications, and actors in the supply
chain (Agyapong-Kodua, Lohse, Darlington, & Ratchev, 2013; Janssen &
Feenstra, 2010; Stiakakis & Georgiadis, 2011).
While no explicit downside of STs was discussed in the reviewed
literature, the literature nevertheless identified a related critical success
factor for realizing the potential benefits of STs for supply chain performance: establishing a strong ontology and standards (Jardim-Goncalves, Agostinho, Sarraipa, Grilo, & Mendonça, 2013; Stiakakis &
Georgiadis, 2011; Vujasinovic et al., 2009).
3.2.11. Simulation
Simulation (SI) is defined as “the process of designing a model of a
real or hypothetical system to describe and analyze the behaviors of the
system” (de Paula Ferreira, Armellini, & De Santa-Eulalia, 2020, pp.
5–6). Assessment of future outcomes and the current system along with
digital visualization are identified as the main benefits of SI in the literature. SI enables the prediction and evaluation of potential future
outcomes from diverse events that can affect supply chain systems. Examples are disruptions in material flows, changes in client behaviors,
product innovations by competitors, new policies, and unilateral process
alterations of a supply chain partner (Baruffaldi, Accorsi, & Manzini,
2019; Barykin, Kalinina, Bochkarev, & Yadykin, 2020; Bechtsis et al.,
2018; Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020). SI evaluates supply chain behavior by
developing a deeper understanding of system dynamics, problems, and
solutions that allow firms to monitor various parameters, such as environmental impacts (Barykin et al., 2020; Bechtsis et al., 2018; Vieira,
Dias, Santos, Pereira, & Oliveira, 2019). SI enables the detailed digital
visualization of the characteristics and behaviors of objects and targets,
providing comprehensive insights for different purposes, such as offering customization (Gustafsson et al., 2019; Kumar & Singh, 2021).
Supply chain companies wanting to utilize SI often find it challenging to acquire the required skillset, build the technological infrastructure, and to develop a digital twin of the supply chain to conduct simulations
(Barykin et al., 2020; Tsolakis et al., 2019). There may also be difficulties associated with capturing dynamic operational information needed
for a simulation (Baruffaldi et al., 2019; Tsolakis et al., 2019). Data input
quality is a critical success factor in running simulations related to supply
chains. Such data needs to be accurate, relevant, and collected at the
right time (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020; Tsolakis et al., 2019; Vieira et al.,
2019).
3.2.12. Industry 4.0 in general
Overall, the Industry 4.0 can be described as “a new sociotechnical
paradigm that depends on further development, access, and integration
of information and communication technologies (ICT) with automation
technologies to promote end-to-end systems integration across the entire
value chain” (de Paula Ferreira et al., 2020, p. 2). The reviewed literature emphasizes that the core technologies can offer enhanced contributions to supply chain performance when they are utilized in
combination with one another (e.g., Hahn, 2020; Junge, 2019). For
example, Vieira et al. (2019) argue for combining BDTs and SI to
improve the data input to assess system behavior and potential scenarios
under different circumstances. Rejeb et al. (2019) and Mondal et al.
(2019) draw attention to the security that blockchain brings to the IoT.
Moreover, our SLR revealed four general benefits of the Industry 4.0 for
supply chains — optimization, integration, better environmental performance (“green” supply chains), and improved customer value. In
terms of supply chain optimization, the Industry 4.0 has been found to
facilitate self-organization and to contribute to improvements in scalability, innovation, productivity, quality of operations, and efficiency
(Esfahani et al., 2019; Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021; Hahn, 2020;
Strandhagen et al., 2017). Moreover, the Industry 4.0 provides supply
chains with connectivity, transparency, and traceability based on realtime information. This can result in analytical insights that foster flexibility in a supply chain when circumstances change; it can support
decision making and planning, and improve the anticipation of issues
before they occur (Banyai, ´ Ill´es, & Banyai, ´ 2018; Eslami, Jafari, Achtenhagen, Carlb¨
ack, & Wong, 2021; Krykavskyy et al., 2019). Furthermore, the Industry 4.0 makes integration possible by enhancing
intelligence, transparency, and connectivity on the supply chain level. It
facilitates the coordination of material flows and reduced transaction
costs, which promote closer collaboration and enhanced reliability
among supply chain actors (Barata et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2021;
Winkelhaus & Grosse, 2020). The Industry 4.0 contributes to the
emergence of green supply chains because it helps improve recycling
streams (Esmaeilian et al., 2020; Sandvik & Stubbs, 2019), reduce energy/resource consumption, and lessen waste creation (Fatorachian &
Kazemi, 2021; Junge, 2019; Sharma et al., 2021). The Industry 4.0 enables customization associated with product/service bundling, which
can enhance customer value, establish close ties with customers, and
provide the opportunity to respond rapidly to their demands (B¨
ar,
Herbert-Hansen, & Khalid, 2018; Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021; Ghadge,
Kara, Moradlou, & Goswami, 2020).
F.F. Rad et al. 
Industrial Marketing Management 105 (2022) 268–293
281
Firms need to overcome many challenges to realize these benefits for
their supply chains. Business adjustment is a challenging task in seeking
to exploit the promises of the Industry 4.0 at the supply chain level. To
make the most of the Industry 4.0, business and supply chain processes
must be re-engineered and new protocols, models, and standards
developed (Agrawal & Narain, 2021; Luthra & Mangla, 2018; Winkelhaus & Grosse, 2020). Moreover, the adoption of Industry 4.0 solutions
at the supply chain level can mean large initial investments as well as high
operating expenditures since some technologies can consume large
quantities of energy (Bar ¨ et al., 2018; Gawankar, Gunasekaran, &
Kamble, 2020; Kumar & Singh, 2021). Another challenge concerns data
security and legal issues. As the Industry 4.0 expands, data integration
among supply chain actors is vital in order to strengthen security,
although it is a cumbersome process (Birkel, Veile, Müller, Hartmann, &
Voigt, 2019; Eslami et al., 2021; Luthra & Mangla, 2018; Szozda, 2017).
In addition, governments need to establish relevant and responsive laws
on various aspects of the Industry 4.0 (e.g., information privacy), and
firms adopting Industry 4.0 solutions will be mandated to comply with
them. However, this legal process will take time to secure a smooth
enactment (Birkel et al., 2019; Luthra & Mangla, 2018). Moreover,
skilled employees are in demand to deal with Industry 4.0 applications,
but they are often in short supply (Büyükozkan ¨ & Goçer, ¨ 2018;
Gawankar et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021).
One of the most critical success factors in benefitting from the Industry 4.0 is business-supply-chain alignment with the applied Industry 4.0
solutions. Both technology and business perspectives need to be considered (e.g., Ali & Aboelmaged, 2021; Asdecker & Felch, 2018; Patrucco
et al., 2020). These considerations should include Industry 4.0 adoption
strategies and goals, business models, business culture and structures,
and associated risks. Proper communication and integration channels
are required to facilitate cooperation, interaction, and consistent decision making on the supply chain level (e.g., Barata, 2021; Sandvik &
Stubbs, 2019; Szozda, 2017). Managerial and technological knowledge
and awareness regarding benefits, challenges, and critical success factors should be developed along the supply chain (e.g., Frazzon, Rodriguez, Pereira, Pires, & Uhlmann, 2019; Ghadge et al., 2020;
Strandhagen, Buer, Semini, Alfnes, & Strandhagen, 2020). To make a
successful transition to the Industry 4.0, top management teams need to
understand what the Industry 4.0 can bring to the table and what it
cannot. If top management teams are confident and the initial steps into
the Industry 4.0 show promise, top management support and commitment
are likely to grow, and further steps will likely follow (Birkel et al., 2019;
Frederico et al., 2019).
3.3. Benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of Industry 4.0
technologies for supply chain performance: A framework
Based on the analyses and syntheses of the systematic review, we
propose a framework that depicts the influence of benefits, challenges,
and critical success factors on supply chain performance (see Fig. 6).
Supply chain performance is defined as the ability of a supply chain to
create value for its stakeholders and satisfy their interests (e.g., Akkermans et al., 2003; Smith & Reece, 1999). Benefits refer to potential
positive implications that Industry 4.0 technologies have for supply
chain performance, and challenges refer to potential negative implications of Industry 4.0 technologies. Critical success factors refer to conditions that need to be present and measures that need to be taken in
order to realize the value-creation potential of benefits or to prevent the
value-destruction potential of challenges from materializing.
Across the Industry 4.0 and the 11 core technologies investigated in
our SLR, the most commonly emphasized benefits are supply chain
integration and optimization. Supply chain integration comprises the
integration of information along the supply chain as well as the integration of supply chain actors (i.e., enhanced collaboration). Optimization alludes to improvements in supply chain processes that are
manifested in, for example, superior efficiency, quality, and speed. In
contrast, high cost and human resource (HR) issues are the most
frequently highlighted challenges associated with Industry 4.0 technologies, which could negatively affect supply chain performance. Costrelated challenges are predominantly related to high up-front investments necessary to acquire the respective technologies and to prepare the infrastructure for their application. HR-related challenges
emerge from the fact that Industry 4.0 technologies often require
existing employees to adopt their work routines, develop new skills and/
or require the hiring of new employees with specialized expertise.
Existing employees may be hesitant to do so, while new hires with the
Fig. 6. Framework of the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors regarding supply chain performance in Industry 4.0.

282
desired competence profile are not always available in sufficient quantity and quality. Finally, alignment and managerial support are the most
commonly cited critical success factors. Alignment designates congruence and compatibility of business goals, technological vision, strategies, and activities. For a strong supply chain performance, these
elements not only need to be aligned among the actors involved in the
individual firm, but there also needs to be a corresponding fit among the
interdependent, yet formally often independent, firms in the supply
chain. Since the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies requires
fundamental changes in intra- and inter-organizational processes and
plans, the committed involvement of top management in the transformation of their individual firms and their entire supply chains is
pivotal.
4. Benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of Industry
4.0 technologies for supply chain performance: A future research
agenda
Our literature review indicates that the interest in the implications of
Industry 4.0 technologies for supply chains grew exponentially from
2015 to 2019 and has remained at a high level since. As a consequence,
about three times as many studies on this topic were published in the
period 2018 to 2021 as had been published before. This development
can be seen as a testament to the topic’s economic and organizational
significance. Hence, developing a sound understanding and a cumulative body of knowledge is essential. Our analysis has revealed that future
research can benefit from focusing on different elements of the proposed
framework separately or jointly – benefits, challenges, critical success
factors, and core Industry 4.0 technologies for supply chain performance. Table 4 offers a detailed future research agenda, which can assist
scientists in supply chain management, Industry 4.0 technologies, and
related fields.
Our SLR reveals that, in general, the benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies for supply chains have been discussed more extensively than
their challenges and critical success factors. Paying too little attention to
their challenges and critical success factors is problematic and detrimental. For one thing, it leaves firms without evidence-based academic
guidance on how to implement Industry 4.0 technologies. For another,
overemphasizing the upsides can result in biased expectations. If the
technologies do not very quickly live up to the unrealistic expectations
of managers, firms may abort their transition to the Industry 4.0 and
forego the associated benefits. Failing to meet expectations is more
likely when managers lack guidance on how to implement their technologies. In other words, research on challenges and on critical success
factors are complementary, and both strands should be pursued with
equal vigor in the future. At the same time, studying the benefits of
Industry 4.0 technologies will remain crucial as technologies develop,
new technologies emerge, and new application areas for given technologies are explored. Thus, the benefits of the Industry 4.0 described in
previous research and consolidated in our SLR are by no means
exhaustive.
Additionally, our SLR shows that the diverse technologies at the core
of the Industry 4.0 vary in the extent to which they have been covered by
prior research. While some core technologies are discussed frequently
(e.g., additive manufacturing and the Internet of Things), others are
under-explored (e.g., semantic technologies, augmented reality, the
Internet of People, and robotics). Scholars should aim for a better understanding of the implications of hitherto under-researched technologies for supply chains to balance the disproportionate coverage.
Moreover, not all components and facets of the heavily covered core
technologies are equally well understood. For example, a significant
share of papers subsumed under the IoT label have focused on RFID (e.
g., Gessner et al., 2007; Roussos, 2008; Wang et al., 2010), but IoT goes
far beyond RFID. Conversely, there can be technological components
and facets in seemingly mature areas that are still in dire need of more
research. There are also differences in interpretation and categorization

of core technologies across scholars. Hence, further conceptualization of
core Industry 4.0 technologies and their boundaries is needed to achieve
common ground on terminologies, capabilities, characteristics, and subvariants in specific technological categories.
Moreover, we have observed that multiple core technologies of the
Industry 4.0 can complement or substitute for one another. The interaction of technologies and the question of how the benefits, challenges,
and critical success factors can change when two or more Industry 4.0
technologies are considered in combination represents a highly promising avenue for future research. Many technologies continue to evolve,
and new functions and capabilities are emerging (e.g., the “Industry
5.0”; Maddikunta et al., 2021). The alignment of core Industry 4.0
technologies with the existing legacy information systems – and with the
newest technologies in the process of development, such as quantum
computers – is an interesting future research avenue.
Our SLR reveals that relevant research is spread across an enormous
number of journals and even across very diverse scientific domains (see
Table 2), reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the topic. Additional
literature reviews and other consolidation techniques could, therefore,
contribute to an interdisciplinary dissemination of insights and detect
inconsistencies in assumptions and findings across domains. In particular, more studies are needed that consider the business perspective of
Industry 4.0 technologies and their implications for the supply chain.
Currently, the majority of studies have been grounded in a computer
science perspective. This technology-centered view needs to be complemented with socio-economic analyses to generate the necessary
knowledge that can guide the implementation of these technologies. In
particular, we encourage researchers to adopt a holistic perspective in
future studies, considering the analytical lenses of business, computer
science, and organizational science to overcome “the silos of disciplines”
and the risk of being “lost in translation”. In addition, future studies
could seek to uncover differences in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies
in supply chains across various types of firms (e.g., small and mediumsized enterprises [SMEs] vs. large, multinational corporations),
various levels of digital maturity, and across sectors, geographical locations, and cultural contexts.
Finally, we observed that more than 50% of the articles selected have
applied empirical methods. However, since the technologies at the core
of Industry 4.0 are still constantly evolving, there is an opportunity to
conduct more conceptual and mixed-methods research to exploit the full
potential of these technologies. The application of quantitative research
methods is nevertheless important to test and validate the constructs.
For example, approaches such as interpretive structural modelling and
analytical hierarchy processing could be well-suited to an examination
of the relationships between benefits, challenges, and success factors.
Embracing Industry 4.0 technologies and an interorganizational logic
are key for successful servitization (Khanra et al., 2021; Kohtamaki ¨
et al., 2021).

regards to supply chain performance through a systematic literature
review. The study covers 221 articles from more than 100 different
journals, comprising the Internet of People, the Internet of Things, cloud
computing, big data technologies, blockchain, augmented reality, automation, robotics, additive manufacturing, simulation, and semantic technologies
as core technological components of the Industry 4.0. The most
frequently discussed implications in the reviewed literature across the
11 core technologies are integration and optimization in terms of benefits,
high costs and human resources in terms of challenges, and alignment and
top management support in terms of critical success factors. We integrated
the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of the 11 Industry
4.0 technologies with respect to supply chain performance in an overarching framework (Fig. 6). Finally, we derived a detailed agenda for
future research from our analysis. This detailed future research agenda
(see Table 4) can assist scholars in the supply chain and Industry 4.0
domains in conducting highly relevant and impactful further research.
In summary, further work is needed with respect to i) the challenges and
critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; ii) hitherto underresearched technologies (e.g. Semantic Technologies, Augmented Reality, and the Internet of People), newly emerging technologies, and
under-represented components and facets of heavily covered technologies (such as the Internet of Things); iii) synergies and trade-offs among
the core technologies; and (iv) the interdisciplinary dissemination and
consolidation of relevant findings.
5.1. Theoretical implications
This study offers three contributions to the supply chain management and Industry 4.0 literatures. First, the study contributes to the
discussion on how to implement different Industry 4.0 technologies in
the supply chain context (Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021; Pfohl et al.,
2015). Although several SLRs on the impact of Industry 4.0 on supply
chains already exist (e.g., Barata, 2021; Frederico et al., 2019; Meindl
et al., 2021; Ghadge et al., 2020), these SLRs do not comprehensively
cover multiple technologies at the core of the Industry 4.0. Instead, the
existing SLRs have used rather specific focuses, such as mobile technologies (Barata et al., 2018), sustainability (Bag, Telukdarie, Pretorius,
& Gupta, 2018; Yadav et al., 2020), proximity of partners (Dallasega
et al., 2018), technology transfer (Da Silva, Kovaleski, & Pagani, 2019),
and various levels of integration (Tiwari, 2021). By covering an extensive set of 11 core technologies of the Industry 4.0, our study helps
identify the broader implications of these technologies for supply chain
performance in terms of benefits, challenges, and success factors. Such a
comprehensive review of several core technologies establishes a good
foundation for scientists to build on. This exceptionally comprehensive
perspective makes a significant contribution to supply chain management because existing technologies are continuously changing, and new
technologies are continuously emerging.
Second, this study maps the benefits, challenges, and critical success
factors of 11 core technologies for supply chain performance. This
mapping is an important and novel contribution that could help us understand the complex technological components of the Industry 4.0. In
fact, many researchers acknowledge that a good starting point for the
adaptation and transformation of supply chains in the move towards the
Industry 4.0 is the identification of benefits, challenges, and critical
success factors (e.g., Sony et al., 2021; Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021;
Ghadge et al., 2020; Bag et al., 2018). The exiting literature on the Industry 4.0 for supply chains either covers benefits (Barata, 2021; Da
Silva et al., 2019; Frederico et al., 2019), challenges (Ghadge et al.,
2020; Luthra & Mangla, 2018), success factors (Yadav et al., 2020;
Tiwari, 2021) or several combinations (Bag et al., 2018; Dallasega et al.,
2018; Ding et al., 2018), but not all of them comprehensively at once.
Third, this study contributes to the implementation of Industry 4.0
technologies in supply chains by providing a structured foundation for
further discussion of potential benefits, challenges, and success factors
of specific Industry 4.0 technologies. The framework we develop
advances a holistic approach to supply chain management (Bag et al.,
2018; Barata, 2021; Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2021; Meindl et al., 2021).
5.2. Practical implications
Our study will benefit supply chain managers, digitalization managers, technology officers, and related practitioners, who are driving
digitalized supply chain or Industry 4.0 initiatives. The proposed
framework could help these managers develop a more holistic understanding of technologies at the core of the Industry 4.0 and their implications in terms of potential benefits, challenges, and success factors.
In particular, the 11 core technologies offer managers a broad set of
potential options to fulfil the needs of their specific supply chains. As
companies struggle to build advanced digital supply chains, this
framework could be used to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a focal company, coordinate the corresponding
investment efforts, and prepare the related operational steps. For
example, the potential benefits and challenges of different core technologies can be discussed and compared to the needs of the company
and the corresponding supply chain.
Additionally, managers could use the proposed framework to discuss
the limitations of available legacy systems in the company and possible
means to overcome them with Industry 4.0 technologies. Furthermore,
companies could use this framework when they formulate a reference
architecture model (Moghaddam, Cadavid, Kenley, & Deshmukh, 2018)
for digitalized/smart supply chains. Hence, the proposed descriptive
framework can act as a guiding tool for managers to select and integrate
Industry 4.0 technologies to improve their supply chain performance. As
digitalization is unlikely to disappear and the fourth industrial revolution forces more and more businesses and supply chains to undergo a
digital transformation, our study can hopefully inspire much more
research on this relevant topic. Finally, Industry 4.0 supply chains
(alternatively, “supply chain 4.0”) could naturally be part of and play a
significant role in many current trends, such as digital servitization, the
circular economy, the sharing economy, and electrification (e.g., Palmi´e
et al., 2021; Palmi´e, Wincent, Parida, & Caglar, 2020). Researchers in
these domains could use the results of our study to conceptualize and
prepare a successful digital transformation of supply chains.
