ABSTRACT Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) constitute a large fraction of many countries’
economies but according to the literature SMBs are not adequately implementing cyber security which
leaves them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, research in cyber security is rarely focused on SMBs,
despite them representing a large proportion of businesses. In this paper we review recent research on the
cyber security of SMBs, with a focus on the alignment of this research to the popular NIST Cyber Security
Framework (CSF). From the literature we also summarise the key challenges SMBs face in implementing
good cyber security and conclude with key recommendations on how to implement good cyber security.
We find that research in SMB cyber security is mainly qualitative analysis and narrowly focused on the
Identify and Protect functions of the NIST CSF with very little work on the other existing functions. SMBs
should have the ability to detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks, and if research lacks in those areas,
then SMBs may have little guidance on how to act. Future research in SMB cyber security should be more
balanced and researchers should adopt well-established powerful quantitative research approaches to refine
and test research whilst governments and academia are urged to invest in incentivising researchers to expand
their research focus.

I. INTRODUCTION
On the global level, SMBs are responsible for more than
90 percent of the worldwide business economy [1]. In
Australia in particular, SMBs make up 98% of all Australian
businesses, producing one-third of the total GDP and employing 4.7 million people [2] whilst in the UK, SMBs make
up 99.9% of all businesses [3]. Since there are varying definitions of SMBs or small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs)
[4], [5], we are using the definition of the Australian
Bureau of Statistics defining SMBs as businesses employing
between 5 – 199 staff [6].
Based on the major role that SMBs play in the economy,
it would be expected that they would adequately implement
cyber security strategies. However this is not the case as

explained in [7], and this makes them susceptible to financial,
productivity and legal costs that can even lead to bankruptcy.
Attackers have now turned to the easy target of SMBs
many of which are either unaware [8] or not well resourced to
fortify their networks and information resources [9]. Despite
there being well known measures to protect businesses from
cyber-attacks, SMBs continue to be victims [10]. Statistics
show that 62% of Australian SMBs reported to have been a
victim of cyber-attacks [11]. This statistic is closely aligned
with the 2017 global statistic where 66% of SMBs reported
their organization experiencing a cyberattack in the previous
12 months. These statistics are not only a concern for SMBs
but also a concern for suppliers and customers who do business with them [12].
Cyber security is defined as ‘‘the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorised access or criminal
use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and

availability of information’’ [13]. Cyber security research is
a growing field with numerous topics which authors such
as Suryotrisongko and Musashi have tried to develop taxonomies for [14]. Our study was necessitated by the realisation that there was very limited literature available regarding
the cyber security of SMBs – both in Australia and globally
[15]. To the best of our knowledge, only two surveys of a
similar nature have been done [15], [16] which we discuss
in more detail in Section IV. None of the existing surveys
aligned their surveyed research to a well-known security
framework or analysed the geographic spread of the surveyed
research.
This motivated our study on the available literature and its
focus as well as areas of SMB research that are underrepresented. From our experience and assertions from others [17],
the practical and cohesive application of cyber security
practices in industry is accomplished through the adoption
of cyber security frameworks which provide structure and
methodology [18]. Many frameworks exist, among which
the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber
Security Framework (NIST CSF) is popular amongst SMBs.
Using the NIST CSF as a benchmark, the aim of our research
is to understand the focus of previous SMB cyber security
research and identify areas that may be lacking. The secondary aim is to establish in which countries or regions SMB
cyber security research is being conducted, what research
methodologies are being used and which data gathering techniques are being employed. Another aim was to analyse what
researchers identified as the challenges faced by SMBs and
what the recommended cyber security practices are.
Our study asked the following questions:
1. What has been the focus of SMB cyber security
research?
2. How does past and current SMB cyber security
research align with the widely used NIST CSF?
3. What areas of SMB cyber security research need more
focus?
4. What is the most common SMB cyber security research
methodology?
5. What data gathering techniques are SMB cyber security
researchers using?
6. What is the geographic spread of SMB cyber security
research?
7. What are the common challenges affecting SMB implementation of good cyber security?
8. What are the recommended cyber security practices for
SMBs?
Compared to [15], [16] our work discusses a much larger
body of relevant literature and categorizes the literature using
a taxonomy based on NIST CSF. Hence, our survey covers
more depth and breadth than existing work.
We anticipate that the results of this study will be useful to SMB cyber security researchers, academic institutions, research institutions, governments, and policy makers.
Researchers can adopt a more targeted approach to their
SMB cyber security research by focussing more on the underrepresented research areas. Academic/research institutions
and governments could also incentivise researchers to carry
out research in the lacking areas to ensure a well-balanced
approach and ultimately help secure SMBs and subsequently
the economies.
In section II to set the scene we discuss the difference between SMBs and larger organisations, current cyberattacks and their cost to SMBs. In section III we briefly
discuss cyber security frameworks and standards applicable
to SMBs with a focus on the NIST framework which we use
to classify the existing literature. In section IV we discuss
the few existing surveys in this area. In section V we explain
the paper selection criteria for the survey. In section VI we
present our survey in two parts. Firstly, we discuss the challenges identified in previous literature and secondly, we discuss the literature through the lens of the NIST framework.
In section VII we discuss the findings and summarize the
recommendations for a good cyber security posture of SMBs.
Section VIII presents the conclusions of this work.
II. CYBER SECURITY SITUATION FOR SMBS
In this section we discuss the differences between SMBs and
large organisations when it comes the cyber security situation.
We continue to discuss current cyber-attacks against SMBs
and their cost implications.
A. SMBS VS. LARGE ENTERPRISES
Cyber threats do not discriminate by organisation size,
which means SMBs are susceptible to the same threats as
large organisations [19]. Although larger enterprises have
a larger attack surface with more employees and devices,
larger organisations also, in most cases, have the human and
financial resources to put in place controls [9], [20]. Larger
organisations tend to have dedicated cyber security staff with
appropriate levels of education [21]. SMBs invest less in
cyber security [20], however when it comes to the financial
impact of successful cyber-attacks, they suffer higher costs
proportionately than large businesses [10], [22]. SMBs however have the potential advantage of being small and agile
with more flexible IT arrangements [23].
Industry research revealed that although cyber risk became
more firmly entrenched in larger organisations’ priorities in
the past few years, the confidence of many organisations in
their ability to manage cyber risk had declined as they were
found to still struggle to articulate, approach and act upon
cyber risk despite having the relevant human and financial
resources [24]. They were also found struggling to educate
and train their employees on cyber security [25], a challenge
also common in SMBs.
Williams and Manheke [26] argued that cyber security
threats to small business should be treated as a matter of
national security. They argued that in a country like Australia
where much of the business and economy lies in the hands
of small businesses, the financial well-being of large groups
of society could be affected by cyber-attacks on the business
85702 VOLUME 10, 2022

sector impinging on the confidence on e-commerce and the
economy as a whole.
B. SMBS UNDER ATTACK
Hayes and Bodhani [27] found that SMBs are being increasingly targeted by online threats because they are perceived as
being inherently more vulnerable. New and less experienced
cyber criminals often attack easy targets among which SMBs
are featured [28]. The authors attribute this lax security to
SMBs planning their IT security under the misconception that
their networks and data are already safe.
A 2020 report from Verizon indicated that the attacks
are far reaching with every organisation no matter the size,
industry or sector, falling victim [19]. It is noted however
that globally, health care service providers and finance related
businesses are the most targeted [29], [30]. Academia and
industry reports reveal that the most common cyber-attack
types experienced by SMBs included: social engineering
(e.g., phishing), hacking (e.g., stolen credentials, data theft),
malware (e.g., ransomware), misuse (e.g., malicious insider),
web-based attacks and ecommerce supply chain attacks [19],
[31], [32], [33], [34]. Fig. 1 below shows the results from the
Ponemon Institute’s 2018 study showing phishing or social
engineering attacks as the most prominent types of attack
experienced by SMB respondents [31].
FIGURE 1. Types of attack experienced by SMBs from [31]. Social
engineering is the most prominent attack and increasing from previous
years.
Globally and across all organisations, web application
servers appear to be the most targeted IT assets in data
breaches largely due to the shift towards web-based applications due to an increasing consumption of services offering cloud-based software-as-a-service platforms. Other assets
under attack are users’ desktops and laptops, email servers,
database servers and the end-users themselves [19]. Some
researchers believe that mobile devices [35] and other IoT
devices are the most vulnerable devices in the SMB environment which are most likely to be compromised and allow
attackers entry into the network [8], [36], [37].
Unsecured online devices can also be weaponised to carry
out sophisticated attacks on other organisations. For example,
devices can be coerced into Botnets, awaiting instructions to
join online distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks [38].
As reported in [22], 70% of recent global breaches were
perpetrated mainly by external actors, i.e., attackers from
outside the company. Almost half of these attacks involved
intrusion or gaining unauthorised access. The vast majority
(86%) of these breaches were financially motivated, however
cyber incidents and data breaches have several other motivators which include fun, ideology, grudges, espionage, state
sponsored and human error [19].
Although most cyber-attacks were from external actors,
in 2018, 16% of SMBs reported suffering an insider
attack [31]. Williams and Manheke argued that human error
both intentional and unintentional has a great impact on
SMBs given that it affects many areas of protecting computer systems [26]. For example, in 2011 the Maricopa
County Community College District (MCCCD) suffered a
data breach with some of the college’s databases being posted
for sale on the dark web. Investigations revealed the issue was
caused by an employee but did not reveal whether the data
was intentionally or accidentally leaked [39]. In Australia,
11% of data breaches reported to the Office of The Australian
Information Commissioner (OAIC) were the result of a rogue
employee or insider attack [29].
C. COST OF POOR CYBER SECURITY FOR SMBS
Cyber-attacks are becoming more severe in terms of negative
consequences such as financial impacts [40]. According to
the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC),
cybercrime is costing the Australian economy up to $1 billion
annually in direct costs alone. The impact of cybercrime can
be far reaching with other indirect costs coming in the form
of damage to personal identity, loss of business or employment opportunities and significant impact on emotional and
psychological wellbeing [41]. It is reported that about 60% of
small businesses that were victims of a cyberattacks went out
of business within six months [42]. This demonstrates that
small businesses have a lot to lose if cyber threats materialise
and it is in their best interest to have cyber defences in place.
Lost business was one of the largest costs for small business, along with financial loss, lawsuits, victim compensation, fines and internal investigations [30]. Once a data
breach has occurred, the cost of compliance activities, training, research and upgrades to infrastructure could be signifinact [43]. In addition, businesses are susceptible to repeat
attacks given hackers are likely to return. Research highlights
that 28% of non-compliant victims are likely to suffer another
breach within two years after the initial attack [44].
In the case of the payment and card industry, noncompliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) could lead to be the business not
being able to accept credit card payments for the goods
sold or services rendered [45]. Other risks of fallout from
not being compliant can be reputational. SMBs suffer a
VOLUME 10, 2022 85703
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
disproportionately higher financial impact from cyber-attacks
when their losses are adjusted to organizational size and
revenue [22]. As of 2019, smaller organisations were found
to have higher costs relative to their size than larger organisations, incurring an average cost of USD $3533 per
employee, compared to USD $204 per employee for larger
organisations [10]. The average cost of a data breach in
Australia is $2.13 million while companies spend an average
of $1.2 million due to damage or theft of IT assets and infrastructure. Additionally, disruption to normal operations cost an
average of $1.9 million and these figures continue to increase
from previous years [10], [31], [46].
Lloyd [47] claims that effective cyber security allows a
business to demonstrate a high level of corporate social
responsibility, showing customers commitment to security
and privacy which leads to customer retention. Conversely
it can be argued that ineffective cyber security demonstrates
a lack of corporate social responsibility and disregard for
customer security and privacy, leading to loss of customers.
Given many damaging data breaches are not reported, large
organisations are now scrutinising the security practices of
potential SMB third parties or suppliers to ensure a secure
end-to-end supply chain can be achieved [12]. The US retailer
Target suffered a large data breach in 2013 after hackers
exploited the network access of a small heating, ventilation,
and air-conditioning system supplier [48].
The existence of good cyber security practices in an SMB
creates a competitive advantage for them in the market. It creates opportunities for lucrative supply chain contracts for
which SMBs would not otherwise be a contender without
good cyber security. A good example is the stringent cyber
security compliance requirement that the US Department of
Defence now imposes on defence contractors which is likely
to preclude a lot of SMBs from bidding for defence contracts
[49]. Effectively, SMBs who fail to invest in data security and
governance miss out on market opportunities. When cyber
security is not a priority it can become a growth inhibitor for
an SMB.
III. CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORKS
Cyber security frameworks define best practices that SMBs
can follow to manage cyber security risk, establish a common
language internally and externally, standardise service delivery and improve efficiency [50]. As pointed out by previous
researchers, SMBs should adopt these frameworks to guide
their cyber security implementations [15], [28].
A. NIST CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORK
The taxonomy we use to classify the literature is based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber
Security Framework (CSF) which was developed to help
improve the security of critical infrastructure organisations
in the USA [51]. It is a voluntary framework developed from
existing standards, guidelines, and practices as well as with
input from industry and government [52]. The framework
provides a policy framework for organisations to assess and
improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks [53].
Although initially developed for critical infrastructure
organisations, the framework has proven to be flexible and
useful to other organisations [54]. By implementing the
framework, organisations are better able to cost-effectively
manage their cyber security risks, maximising their return on
security investment [55]. Another notable benefit of NIST is
that it provides a common language reducing confusion on
the meaning of terms used in contracts and other agreements.
The components of the NIST CSF [116], [119] are summarised in TABLE 1 below.
TABLE 1. [53], [57] Nist CSF functions and categories.
NIST recognised that SMBs often do not have security experts at their disposal to interpret the cyber security framework and developed a simplified version of the
NIST Cyber Security Framework specifically for SMBs
which is published as the NIST Interagency Report 7621
(NISTIR 7621) [56].
NISTIR 7621 provides guidance to SMBs on how they can
improve the security of information, including systems and
networks, physical security, personnel security, contingency
planning disaster recovery and operational security [56].
It prescribes actions that small businesses should take
(Essential Practices) and adds ten highly recommended
practices [58].
B. OTHER FRAMEWORKS
The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Essential Eight,
International Standards Organisation (ISO) 27001/2 and the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) are
among other popular frameworks relevant for SMBs [28].
The ASD Essential Eight is an Australian framework
which provides a baseline for organisations in order to protect
themselves [59].
85704 VOLUME 10, 2022
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
ISO 27001 is an international standard, providing specifications for a best-practice Information Security Management
System (ISMS) [60]. ISO 27001 was developed to help organizations protect their information in a systematic and costeffective way through the adoption of an ISMS [61]. The
ISO 27001 standard groups the controls that organisations
can select to tackle information security risks into 14 sets
or domains [62]. ISO 27002 compliments ISO 27001 by
providing more detailed guidance and a reference for selecting security controls within the process of implementing an
ISMS [60].
The PCI DSS is the standard for the protection of cardholder data [45]. The PCI DSS controls framework helps
SMBs to layer their defences around payment card data operations, improving their ability to maintain the confidentiality
and integrity of customers’ payment card details, in turn safeguarding the company’s reputation. However, meeting PCI
DSS compliance has been difficult for SMBs with only one
in five managing to maintain their annual compliance obligations. Boese found that unlike larger corporations, small businesses lack the resources to become PCI DSS-compliant [45].
FIGURE 2. Relationship between cyber security frameworks. Note. This
figure was adopted from Compliance forge [64] and enhanced to show
the relationship with other frameworks such as PCI/DSS and ASD
Essential 8.
SMBs may struggle to meet their business objectives as
well as compliance requirements when adopting a single
framework, thus some researchers recommend to adopt a
hybrid framework [55]. The Secure Controls Framework
(SCF) was developed as a hybrid framework to cover NIST
CSF, NIST 800-53 and ISO 27002 [63]. Fig. 2 shows the
SCF and how some of the frameworks and standards overlap.
Essentially the SCF can be seen as a superset covering NIST
CSF, ISO 27001/2, PCI DSS and ASD Essential Eight.
IV. RELATED SURVEYS
To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two surveys
of a similar nature – one focussed on the UK [16] and one
focussed on Australia [15].
Tam et al. discussed the research data challenges plaguing SMB cyber security researchers where the lack of publicly available data leads to little data being obtained largely
from convenience sampling [15]. Self-reporting is also highlighted as an issue in SMB cyber research which causes
awareness biases. They discuss challenges faced by SMBs
as well as advantages or opportunities for SMBs. They also
highlight the need for research data in businesses with less
than 20 employees.
Alahmari and Duncan’s review of SMB cyber security
research was aimed at revealing the role played by SMB
management in addressing cybersecurity risks [16]. They
analysed 15 articles and identified threats, behaviours, practices, awareness, and decision making as the perspectives that
play a role in SMB cyber security risk management.
Our survey differentiates itself by analysing a much larger
body of literature and aligning the surveyed literature to a
well-known cyber security framework which previous surveys have not done. Our survey categorizes the literature
using a taxonomy based on NIST CSF. Unlike the previous
studies, we also investigate the geographic spread of the
surveyed research.
V. PAPER SELECTION CRITERIA
The literature analysed in this study consists of 40 scholarly academic and peer-reviewed publications, dating back to
2005 (see TABLE 5, Appendix A). For the search we used
the Murdoch University Online library which indexes and
searches popular academic databases and repositories such
as Scopus, Web of Science and many other original research
databases such as IEEE Explore. Outside the Murdoch University online library, Google Scholar was also used to widen
the search. We set the inclusion and search criteria are as
follows:
• Published: 2005 onwards
• Title Contains the terms: cyber security or cyber security
or IT security or cyber risk AND small or medium AND
business or enterprise
• Peer-reviewed journal paper, conference paper, doctoral
dissertation or master’s thesis
• Clearly articulated methodology
Each publication was categorised as journal paper, conference paper, doctoral dissertation or Master’s thesis.
A qualitative systematic review of literature was carried
out, paying attention to the focus of the research questions
and themes of the research. We adopted the qualitative systematic review approach due to the difficulty of performing
meta-analysis of studies within a particular topic. Qualitative
approaches have been developed to review and assess the
quality of research findings, as well as identify patterns and
relationships amongst studies on a particular topic [65], [66].
Publications were shortlisted for analysis and reviewed to
determine the SMB cyber security topic or theme, the country
where the research was conducted, the research methods used
as well as the data collection methods. The resulting process
followed is depicted in Fig. 3.

FIGURE 3. Methodology visualised. This figure visually depicts the
process followed in this research.
We developed the NIST CSF Research Classification
Tool (NCRCT) shown in Fig. 4 to help us align each publication with the functions of NIST CSF. For each included
publication, the research aims, objectives and questions were
parsed through the tool to help determine the NIST CSF category (Table 1) it aligned with. Using this tool, we determined
the corresponding NIST Category or categories.
Furthermore, the research methodology and research
design of each publication were reviewed to establish whether
it was a qualitative, quantitative or mixed method approach
and also to establish what data collection technique was used.
The data collection methods are categorised as shown in
Table 2.
Additionally, as each paper was analysed, the challenges
faced by SMBs were noted and are discussed in Section VI.A
Furthermore, we also identified recommended practices for
SMBs suggested by the literature and discuss these in
Section VII.
It should be noted that our literature search results are
by no means exhaustive. Search results were limited to the
repositories described above. Non-English research repositories could not be accessed and publications in other languages
such as French, German, Chinese would have been precluded.
VI. SMB CYBER SECURITY RESEARCH
Our work investigated the alignment of SMB research to the
popular NIST CSF framework. It also investigated the methods, data gathering techniques and the geographic spread
of past SMB cyber security research. In the process we
also examined the common challenges faced by SMBs in
implementing good cyber security. This section discusses the
findings related to the research questions.
FIGURE 4. NIST CSF research classification tool (NCRCT). This figure shows
the tool which was used to determine the focus of surveyed literature.
TABLE 2. Categorisation of data collection methods.
A. CYBER SECURITY CHALLENGES
Previous research identified several challenges that SMBs
face in implementing sound cyber security. In a recent study,
85706 VOLUME 10, 2022
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
top challenges were found to be the lack of finances to pay for
talent, issues with regulatory compliance as well as a shortage
of professionally available talent [67]. Some researchers have
categorised challenges faced by SMBs into technical, human,
organisational, financial and legal challenges [15]. In the
2018 State of Cyber Security in SMBs study, the three main
challenges faced by small businesses identified were: (i) not
having the in-house expertise to mitigate cyber risk; (ii) IT
budget constraints; and (iii) a general lack of understanding
of how to protect against cyber-attacks [31].
Several other factors are suspected to also influence the
poor cyber security posture of SMBs. Research by Deloitte
[68] suggested that the age of the business owner or manager
played a part in the security posture of their business, as well
as their attitude and use of technology. The major factors
influencing poor SMB cyber security posture are presented
below.
1) UNDERESTIMATING THE RISK
Cyber risk transcends data breaches and privacy concerns.
As Borenstein [69] alluded, the threats have evolved into
more sophisticated schemes that prove very costly, disrupting
entire businesses, industries, supply chains and even nations.
Research has however shown that small business owners
often have the tendency to underestimate cyber security risk
[70], [71].
In Australia, almost half of the SMBs surveyed believed
that they could protect their business from cybercrime by
limiting their online presence. SMBs reported limiting their
online presence to a business website, contact details and
social media, with only 15% of survey respondents offering a business website with product viewing or purchasing
functionality [43]. Notwithstanding the significant economic
benefits of a greater presence online, the SMBs perception
of cyber risk appears to be misguided. Cyber risks transcend
websites and social media to include internet connected desktops, laptops, tablets, phones and nowadays internet connected devices and sensors (IoT) [19]. Any of these could
expose the SMB to a cyberattack. Besides social media use,
55% of SMB owner-operators surveyed alluded to also using
email to communicate, unknowingly exposing themselves to
threats such as phishing and ransomware attacks [43]. They
wrongly assumed limiting their online presence to be a safety
measure preventing cybercrime, simultaneously unaware that
email is the main vehicle for two thirds of malware related
cyber security incidents globally [32].
A survey on small businesses in the US revealed the sector
is more at risk than they think and is not taking necessary steps
or investing in defending against cyberattacks [72]. Over
half the businesses studied had not invested any measures
to mitigate risks as they did not believe that they stored any
valuable data, yet in fact they stored email addresses, phone
numbers, postal addresses, home addresses, social security
numbers and credit card details. This information which the
SMBs perceived not to be of any value, is actually Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which forms the basis for
most privacy regulation in Australia [73] and other countries.
These findings demonstrate that there is an element of naivety
in the operation of small businesses.
Another example from the US is that only one in five
businesses are reported to be able to meet their annual obligations under the PCI DSS standard. Some do not believe that
they have any valuable data assets or business impacting IT
systems; some do not see the business benefits or return on
investment in complying and ignore their obligations [12].
Digital supply chains also introduce new cyber risks for
business [33], [74], [75]. Although many businesses were
found to perceive the risk other supply chain partners introduce to them, they do not perceive the risk they pose to their
supply chain [47].
Bhattacharya [76] asserted that small businesses are always
going to be primarily focused on sales and revenues in order
to survive and stay in business. With this being their core
focus, cyber security issues are likely neglected as they are
not seen as valuable contributions to the core business.
2) LACK OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
Academia and industry researchers have suggested that small
businesses remain exposed and susceptible to attacks because
they do not know what to protect [25], [58], [77], [78], [79].
The work in [77] and [79] found that SMBs are struggling
with the complex demands of carrying out risk assessments
and the manner in which to adopt cyber security best practices
into their organizations.
The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise
Ombudsman alluded that the lack of awareness regarding
cyber security is one of the biggest threats facing small business operators [80]. The lack of cyber security awareness is
evident not only among employees but also among managers
who are the decision makers but found to be unaware of the
technical solutions available to address their cyber security
challenges [16]. SMBs were also found to lack knowledge
in assessing the capabilities of their IT service providers
[28]. A common challenge with SMBs in the financial card
payment industry is a lack of awareness and knowledge on
how to become compliant even with mandatory regulations
such as PCI-DSS [45], [81]. Thus SMBs require help with
creating policies and complying with regulations [15]. SMBs
also struggle to implement crucial monitoring and security
systems (such as a SIEM) due to their complexity and the
requisite skills and knowledge not available to SMBs. This
is not surprising given that research found a lack of appropriate education amongst the IT professionals working in
SMBs [21].
These assertions were confirmed in a 2019 survey of
small businesses, citing insufficient personnel, insufficient
budget and a lack of understanding around how to protect against cyber-attacks, as the biggest challenges for
SMBs when trying to improve their cyber security posture [46]. This situation does not seem to have changed
as recent studies consistently rated these as the main
challenges [10], [31], [46].
VOLUME 10, 2022 85707
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
3) LACK OF RESOURCES
SMBs are less likely to employ dedicated IT staff, let alone
cyber security specialists [74]. A medium or large company may have sustainable resources for dealing with cyberattacks, whereas the relatively low income of a small business
generally equates to fewer resources allocated toward cyber
defence strategies. Fewer human and financial [36], [71], [82]
resources [36], [71], [82] make it difficult for most SMBs
to comply [83] even with regulations such as PCI-DSS [45].
SMBs also fail to adopt more advanced cyber security technologies such as effective technical controls using machine
learning due to the high costs [84]. Some researchers found
that achieving a good level of cyber security awareness was
one of the biggest challenges for organisations today [25],
[79]. The problem is only compounded for SMBs because
they face the same challenge but with much fewer resources
[25]. As a consequence, some SMBs trust their IT service
providers to take care of their cyber security, but without
the necessary contractual arrangements in place or clear definition of the responsibilities [85]. McLaurin recommended
SMBs should align the little resources they have to the threats
that they face [28]. Thus, SMBs require cyber security solutions that are affordable, easy to implement and use [86], [87].
Onwubiko and Lenaghan recommend that SMBs adopt security models that combine multiple security facets together
thereby reducing costs of implementation and management
[9]. The Centria Cyber Security Manager concept is an example of this approach where SMBs can share cyber security
expert costs [8] thus making it affordable.
4) RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
Berry and Berry [88] found that small business owners struggle with risk management approaches for mitigating cyber
threats due to the rapid pace of advancement in technologies.
Some authors even argue that cyber security risks are evolving
faster than the rate of digital technologies evolutions [24].
Thus, the inexperience with security technologies contributes
to SMBs challenges [23]. In a recent study of cyber security
incidents and data breaches, the Ponemon Institute found that
SMBs are ill prepared to deal with risks created by third
parties and the Internet of Things (IoT) which is growing at
an increasingly rapid pace [10].
5) CONFLICTING / EXCESSIVE CYBER SECURITY
INFORMATION
An Australian study in 2017 indicated that general awareness
of cybercrime as a business risk was increasing amongst
Australian SMBs, however many do not know where to get
help from when responding to cybercrime events. They were
found to be looking to multiple sources for help, ranging
from Google searches to government and police [7]. Notably,
38% of respondents reported reaching out to an IT forensic
consultant for help [43].
In a bid to improve the cyber awareness of SMBs, industry, government and other bodies make resources available,
however as Renaud and Wier [7] found, the wealth of online
information is at times conflicting, causing confusion and
uncertainty amongst SMBs. It is possible the overwhelming
availability of cyber security information hinders rather than
helps SMEs. For example, in 2016 financial industry groups
complained to NIST that banks are being burdened with a
growing number of competing cyber security guidelines [89].
Another challenge with cyber security information or messaging is the negative connotations associated with the narrative of data breaches, regulatory fines and business disruption.
Lloyd [47] suggests that business leaders need to reframe
how they think about cyber security, with a focus on the
opportunities that good cyber security presents rather than
the consequences of its absence. For instance, effective cyber
security allows companies to innovate, which drives revenue,
profit and growth [15]. Good cyber security assists businesses
to gain its customers’ trust. Additionally, it gives businesses
credibility in the supply chain, hence creating more opportunities [33], [74], [75].
6) LACK OF PERSEVERANCE
SMBs do care about cyber security despite the limited
implementation of known security precautions [4], however
businesses that start off implementing a number of security
measures may, over time, become lax, especially since there
is no visible benefit that accrues from the extra effort and
expense. They can also inhabit a sense of false security,
having not kept up with the emerging risks.
Renaud [90] found small businesses are inconsistent in
their implementation of security measures based on their
appraisal of threats and the ability to implement risk controls.
Key findings from a 2019 cyber security benchmark report
also showed small businesses are challenged with cyber security initiatives to ensure a quick response to emerging cyber
threats [91].
FIGURE 5. NIST CSF functions - focus of SMB cyber security research. This
figure shows that the Identify and Protect functions of NIST CSF have
been the focus of most previous and current research.
B. FOCUS OF CYBER SECURITY RESEARCH
Our results in Fig. 5 show that SMB cyber security research
has largely been focussed on the Identify (27 out of 40) and
Protect (23 out of 40) functions of the NIST CSF framework, with little work on the Detect (9), Respond (6) and
85708 VOLUME 10, 2022
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
Recover (5) functions. In the Identify function, governance,
risk management strategy and risk assessment were the most
popular topics which researchers (see Table 5, Appendix a).
In the Protect function, most publications researched the
cyber security awareness and training of SMBs with Information protection processes and procedures being the second
most popular category. Overall, across all of the NIST CSF
categories, awareness and training has been the most popular
topic.
The following sub sections will discuss the literature in
relation to its respective NIST function and categories.
1) IDENTIFY
The identify function of the NIST CSF is meant to ensure
that businesses understand the business context, the resources
that support critical functions, and the related cyber security
risks so that they can prioritize efforts, consistent with its
risk management strategy and business needs. Four of the
six categories of the Identify function [55] were represented
in the literature reviewed. The functions Asset Management and Business Environment were not represented in the
literature.
Early SMB cyber security research explored the cyber
threats to SMBs, vulnerabilities, risks and practices [9], [26],
[34], [79], [92], [93], [94]. Whilst other authors were industry
agnostic in their studies, Heikkila et al. targeted their study
to SMBs in the manufacturing industry [8] which had unique
challenges due to digitisation and the adoption of the Internet
of Things (IoT). Valli [95] targeted lawyers who require
education on how to use encryption and were failing to report
cyberattacks to the government’s online reporting tool.
While most researchers focused on the challenges [25]
faced by SMBs, others have found opportunities for SMBs
when it comes to cyber security. Unlike large organisations,
SMBs were found to have the advantage of being small, agile,
and having flexible IT arrangements [15].
Some researchers studied risk management practices in
SMBs whilst some explored strategies SMB use to prevent
breaches, for example [96] and [97]. Several SMB cyber
security researchers focused on the Governance category in
the past decade. Aljumaili [98] explored information security
policies and practices required by SMBs while Patterson [82]
studied policy decisions in small businesses.
Researchers such as Burton-Howard [83] and others
[45], [82], [87] focussed their research on governance and
compliance including policies, legislation and compliance.
Others concentrated on decision making related to cyber
security amongst management in SMBs [82], [96]. Decision
making approaches were found to depend on five perspectives which are cyber security threats, behaviours, practices,
awareness and decision making in order to apply the correct
remedies [16].
Additionally, the deficiency of existing laws was discussed
with better laws to help protect SMBs being called for [83].
Tam et al. added that legal and policy work is needed to
help SMBs become more cyber resilient [15]. Management
is encouraged to ensure a good cyber security culture in their
organisations [87].
Three studies [33], [74], [75] touched on cyber security
supply chain risks – an emerging topic in SMB cyber security. Sangani et al. [74] developed a security and privacy
architecture to help SMBs adopting cloud services. Cloud
providers are part of the supply chain for SMBs adopting
cloud, however their security responsibilities have limitations
with some responsibilities falling in the hands of the cloud
customers. Thus, in addition to understanding cloud benefits,
SMBs are also urged to be aware of their responsibilities
under these arrangements.
Some researchers based their research on cyber security
frameworks such as the NIST CSF [28], [99]. Some designed
new frameworks [74] whilst some identified shortcomings
[94], [100], [101] with existing frameworks and suggested
modifications or enhancements to existing frameworks that
SMBs could adopt. Examples include the SME Cyber Risk
Assessment suggested by Armenia et al. [99] and another by
Emer et al. [102]. Benz and Chatterjee proposed an SME
Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CET) based on the NIST
CSF targeting SMBs. Beachboard et al. [79] proposed an
open development approach to develop a decision heuristic
based risk assessment which allows SMBs to quantify costs
and estimate probabilities for specific threats in their risk
assessments. Considering the difficulty of practically implementing cyber security in SMBs, Borges and Carias proposed
a more holistic framework which provides an implementation
order for SMBs to follow [18]. Bada and Nurse proposed
a framework for education and awareness to support SMBs
[25]. Coertze et al. [101] proposed enhancements to the
Information Security Management Toolbox to help SMBs
with creating automated security policies and monitoring
compliance. There is however very little evidence on the
practical implementation of most of the proposed toolsets and
frameworks.
2) PROTECT
According to NIST [103], the Protect function ‘‘supports the
ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential cyber
security event’’. Examples categories within this Function
include Access Control (validating identities and access to
different systems, facilities, etc.), Awareness and Training
(giving employees and others the ability to be part of the cyber
plan with education and training), Data Security (manage
data according to company standards in order to mitigate
cyber security risks, and protect its Availability, Integrity
and Confidentiality proactively), Information Protection Processes & Procedures (putting in place the policies, processes, and procedures that are needed to manage protection
of assets), Maintenance (continuously repairing information
system components) and Protective Technology (deploying
security solutions needed to protect assets in line with company policies).
Cyber security awareness has been a key focus
of SMB cyber security research in early and recent
VOLUME 10, 2022 85709
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
years [35], [81], [92]. Several works analysed by us had
training and awareness as their key focus with authors like
Valli et al. specifically focusing on the cyber awareness of
lawyers [95] and Milos studying the awareness levels of
IT professionals in SMBs [21]. According to Fehér [75],
it is most important to improve the user’s awareness. The
argument is that SMBs should have a proper understanding
of the threats their businesses face and how to mitigate them
[74]. Cook [85] found that awareness in SMBs studied was
broken into three themes which are: knowledge of third-party
vendors, knowledge of protection and knowledge of strategic
plans.
In general, training was found to raise the awareness and
self-efficacy [81], [95]. Barosy identified making people
aware of their responsibilities and roles in information technology as the critical factor in a cyber security awareness
program for SMBs [97] and should be an ongoing exercise
given the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Carnell [80]
found that loss of sensitive data had a direct correlation with
security awareness and knowledge of cyber security damage.
Like large enterprises, SMBs struggle to educate and train
their workforce except for SMBs the problem is worse due
to a lack of resources [25]. However, cyber awareness and
training is essential to keeping businesses cyber secure and
Carias [18] suggested that every domain of a cyber security
framework should be supported by training and awareness.
Bada and Nurse [25] proposed a cyber awareness programme
for SMBs with key areas of the programme being the initial
engagement with SMEs, improving security practices and
culture, programme and trusted third-party resources / services – all underpinned by a communication strategy.
Cyber security awareness levels of IT professionals in
SMBs was found to be low due to a lack of appropriate education and conflicting priorities since they are not dedicated to
cyber security tasks [21]. Lawyers in Western Australia were
found to need education particularly on the use of encryption
to help protect data in transit or at rest given their professional
privilege and access to sensitive client data. [95].
Policies and procedures are seen as one of the ways SMBs
can solve the challenge aligning their information systems
and resources with requirements of security standards [98].
Several publications in our study were devoted to policies
that SMBs could implement to ensure good cyber security
behaviours in their organisation [96], [98]. McLaurin identified that SMB owners required assistance with writing cyber
security policies [28] as research has shown that a lack of
human and financial resources was a barrier to drafting,
implementing, and complying with sound information security policies [101].
Most recently researchers have studied protective cyber
security technologies in SMBs such as machine learning
[84], [100] which are seen to be effective in protecting
against cyber-attacks. Mercl and Horalek [104] examined
the practical implementation of a Security Incident Event
Monitoring (SIEM) in an SMB environment [104] with
their results showing that SIEM implementation in SMB
environments was both costly and complicated especially
considering SMBs may not have the requisite knowledge and
skills.
The challenges SMBs face when implementing cyber security is another popular theme [36], [71]. Deficiencies in SMB
cyber security was a focal point of several studies. Examples
such as the failure to implement firewalls on devices despite
them being built into operating systems were attributed to
the lack of knowledge and awareness [35]. The majority of
SMBs were also found to not install anti-malware on mobile
devices. SMBs were also found to be deficient in performing
risk assessments in their environments [79].
3) DETECT
According to NIST [103] the Detect function helps ensure
organisations develop and implement appropriate activities to
identify the occurrence of a cyber security event.
The Detect function enables timely discovery of cyber
security events. Examples of categories within this function include: Anomalies and Events (ensuring anomalies and
events are detected, and their potential impact is understood),
Security Continuous Monitoring (implementing security continuous monitoring capabilities to monitor cyber security
events and verify the effectiveness of protective measures
including network and physical activities), and Detection Processes (maintaining detection processes to provide awareness
of anomalous events) [103].
Only six of the papers in our review had the Detect function
as their focus [8], [18], [84], [86], [94], [104]. As shown
in Table 5, four of them fell into the Security Continuous
Monitoring category whilst the remaining two fell into the
Detection Process category. The Anomalies and Events category was not represented.
Whilst virus and malware protection were found to create
net benefits and encourage a positive user experience in
SMBs [86], Heikkila et al. [8] argued that successful security
management hinges on continuous monitoring and SMBs
require easy to deploy security services offering such. They
explored the Centria security laboratory as a low-cost solution
for SMBs in the manufacturing industry to manage their cyber
security including continuous security monitoring. Continuous monitoring of an IT environment is achieved using a
SIEM which researchers Mercl and Horalek focused their
study on [104]. They studied two SMBs implementing the
IBM Security QRadar SIEM and found that such implementations required guidance and assistance from knowledgeable
professionals due to the complexity of the implementation.
The implementation of a SIEM in the SMBs was found
to hinge on the following factors: the number of company
employees; geological division of IT infrastructure; financial
aspects and limitations of the company; the number and type
of devices that are managed by the system and the audit
reporting requirements.
Rawindaran et al. [84] investigated the challenges
SMBs face in adopting Machine Learning Cyber Security
(MLCS). Their study revealed that although MLCS has been
85710 VOLUME 10, 2022
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
successfully applied in many monitoring applications, for
example in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS),
there was still poor adoption of MLCS techniques among UK
SMBs.
Kaila and Nyman [94] stressed the importance of monitoring as it not only allows SMBs to uncover what happened
in the event of a breach, but also helps them make informed
responses to incidents. Carias et al. [18] focussed their study
on the best implementation order for a cyber resilience framework in SMBs. They found that different experts have differing priorities, however a general consensus reached indicated
that detection processes and continuous monitoring should be
implemented together with information security techniques
after implementing governance, risk management, asset management, vulnerability management and business continuity.
4) RESPOND
The Respond function involves activities that ensure organisations develop and implement appropriate activities to take
action regarding a detected cyber security incident [103].
According to NIST, ‘‘the Respond function supports the
ability to contain the impact of a potential cyber security incident’’. Examples of categories within this function
include Response Planning (ensuring response planning process are executed during and after an incident), Communications (managing communications during and after an event
with stakeholders, law enforcement, external stakeholders
as appropriate), Analysis (analysis is conducted to ensure
effective response and support recovery activities including
forensic analysis, and determining the impact of incidents),
Mitigation (mitigation activities are performed to prevent
expansion of an event and to resolve the incident) and
Improvements (the organization implements improvements
by incorporating lessons learned from current and previous
detection / response activities). The Respond function activities such as response planning, impact analysis and improvement from lessons learnt go a long way in ensuring cyber
resilience in SMBs however in their study, Powell et al. [34]
found that almost half of SMBs either did not have an
emergency action plan or did not have it written and fully
implemented. Given the threat landscape is ever evolving,
traditional methods of protecting against known threats we
seen not to be effective enough, thus Carias et al. [18] claimed
that cyber resilience is a more holistic approach to cyber
security which assists SMBs to anticipate, detect, withstand,
recover and evolve after cyber incidents.
Seven out of 40 publications in our review were focused
on the Respond function of the NIST CSF. The Mitigation
category was the most popular category in this function
accounting for over half of the papers. Analysis and Improvements were also represented; however, Response Planning
and Communications were not.
Regarding Mitigation, Kaila and Nyman [94] identified
logs as crucial in the event of a compromised system as they
help uncover what happened and help inform SMBs on deciding on how to respond to incidents. Having good mitigation
strategies also brings a business benefit where the organisation can demonstrate compliance and reasonable effort to
protect the business, customer or staff data should a cyber
incident occur [18]. Alharbi et al. [105] measured how certain
cyber security practices can affect the level of harm caused by
cyber-attacks and found that having a cyber security inspection team and recovery plan reduced the financial damage
caused by cyberattacks in SMBs. For incidents that eventuate,
SMBs were disinterested in reporting the incident or conducting forensic analysis due to the costs of the activities; SMBs
simply wanted to move on rather than spend time determining
the source or cause of attack [106]. Machine learning (ML)
techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) were found to be
very effective in the detection of anomalies and enhancing the
functionality of modern network/host intrusion detection and
prevention systems, however Rawindaran et al. [84] found
that some SMBs were not aware or had disregarded that AI
and ML were built into the cyber security solutions they
invested in. Rawindaran recommended that awareness of AI
and ML in cyber security should be improved amongst SMBs.
5) RECOVER
The recover function of the NIST CSF guides SMBs to put in
place measures to ensure that they can recover normal operations after a cyber security incident [103]. Recommended
activities under this function are designed to enable any business functions and capabilities affected by a cyber-attack to be
able to be restored after the incident. This ability to recover
from or adjust easily to misfortune or change part of cyber
resilience [107]. For SMBs, not only should they be able to
defend against cyberattacks, but they need to be able to return
to normal operations after an incident. Categories under this
function include Recovery Planning (recovery processes and
procedures are executed and maintained to ensure restoration
of systems or assets affected by cyber security incidents),
Improvements (continuous improvements from lessons learnt
and communications to ensure the organisation is well coordinated during cyber incidents [103]) and Communications
(restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties) [103].
Only five [15], [18], [85], [94], [105] of the papers
reviewed focussed on the Recover function with the Recovery Planning category being the most popular category. The
Improvements category was not represented in the literature.
Tam et al. highlighted the lack of research in cyber resilience
which our study also validates. They noted that cyber security
insurance was a challenge for SMBs given it is a new concept
[15]. They added that highly expensive remediation costs of
cyber incidents make it particularly difficult for SMBs to
recover, hence cyber insurance would be the best approach;
however, it is not well understood amongst SMBs. SMBs
were also found to have a reliance on third party vendors for
their infrastructure and security preventative measures [85],
however this does not necessarily mean the third party takes
ownership of the SMB’s recovery planning. Cook’s study
[85] also revealed that SMBs were adopting preventative
VOLUME 10, 2022 85711
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
and protective strategies, however our analysis of Cook’s
results revealed that planning for the worst was not quite
evident amongst the SMBs studied. Planning for the worst
is crucial for recovery in the event that a cyber-attack occurs
and this can be achieved by having a business continuity
plan in place [94]. In their research Alharbi et al. [105]
found that having an inspection team and a recovery plan
reduced the financial damage a cyber-attack had on SMBs
in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, their research revealed having
contact with cyber security authorities statistically reduced
the restoration time following a cyber-attack. They recommended that SMBs should focus more on certain cyber security practices that can decrease the impacts of cyber security
attacks. Carias et al. [18] claimed that cyber resilience was
a more holistic approach which SMBs should adopt and
they proposed a framework to make it easier for SMBs to
implement cyber resilience practices. However, there is no
data on the practical application of this framework.
C. RESEARCH AREAS REQUIRING MORE WORK
Several categories from the Detect, Respond and Recover
functions were underrepresented whilst some categories were
not represented at all. Underrepresented categories include
Detection Process, Security Continuous Monitoring, Analysis, Improvements, Mitigation, Communications and Recovery Planning. Categories with no representation at all include
Maintenance, Anomalies and Events, Response Planning,
Communications, and Improvements.
It is quite evident from the results above that there is limited
research on cyber resilience. Previous researchers have also
found that in practice many organisations narrowly focus on
technology defences and prevention of cyber risk but neglect
other cyber resilience building activities like risk transfer and
response planning aspects which are covered by the Respond
and Recover functions of the NIST CSF [24]. Our results indicate that, overall, little research attention has been given to
the Detect, Respond and Recover functions of the NIST CSF
all of which are part of developing cyber resilience. In 2020,
IBM Security reported that incident response preparedness
was the highest cost saver for businesses when it came to data
breaches, saving businesses on average of USD$2 million in
the event of a data breach [30]. This highlights the importance
of the Respond and Recover functions to businesses.
We believe that the narrow focus of SMB cyber security research is largely attributed to the limited quantity of
research in the area, since most of the research to date has
focused on large enterprises. Our study highlights the need
for additional research in more categories.
D. GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD AND PUBLICATION TYPES
When considering the countries in which SMB-related cyber
security research is conducted/published, the USA had the
highest number of papers overall, accounting for 43% of
publications analysed (Fig. 6). Together with other countries,
Australia was found to be underrepresented in the SMB
cyber security research literature, particularly in the academic
literature of master’s theses and doctoral dissertations. Outside the USA and Australia, the majority of the relevant
research is conducted in Europe. Africa, Asia, the Middle
East and South America are underrepresented with little to
no publications on SMB cyber security. We suspect the lack
of literature from Asia and South America may be due to nonEnglish publications not accessible to us.
FIGURE 6. Total publications by country. This figure shows the geographic
spread of literature surveyed in this study.
Table 3 shows that journal papers were the most popular
type of publication accounting for 47.5% of the literature
reviewed. They were followed in popularity by conference
papers (20%) and doctoral dissertations (17.5%) and lastly
master’s thesis at 15%. Between 2005 and 2013, there were
few publications examining SMB cyber security with an
average of one publication each year. Between 2013 and
2014 there was an increase in the number of doctoral dissertations and master theses focused on the topic.
FIGURE 7. SMB cyber security research - Publications over time. This
figure shows a gradual increase in SMB cyber security research since
2013.
It is encouraging that the number of publications on the
topic has increased in recent years. Fig. 7 shows a general
upward trend indicating a growing interest in the topic among
researchers.
E. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY USED
As shown in Fig. 8, we found that SMB cyber security
researchers have been predominantly using qualitative methods (70%) as opposed to quantitative (25%) and mixed
methods (5%). These findings are consistent with previous
research which found that a large proportion of cyber security
research is focussed on risk with most researchers using
85712 VOLUME 10, 2022

TABLE 3. Percentages of publication types.
FIGURE 8. Research methodology used by SMB cyber security
researchers. Most researchers are using qualitative methods to research
cyber security in SMBs.
qualitative methods to assess cyber risk [108]. Information
security is viewed as being too complex to model with quantitative methods but authors like Douglas and Seiersen [109]
strongly advocate for evidence-based research methods in
cyber security, as opposed to testimonial-based methods of
identifying cyber security best practices and effectiveness
of controls. They emphasise the role of cyber experts in
computing cyber security metrics to ensure a factual and
unbiased outcome. In 2019, 30% of organisations reported
using quantitative methods to express cyber risk exposures,
up from 17% in the previous two years. Marsh recommends
that organisations should quantify cyber security risks to drive
better informed investment, and performance measurements
thus treating cyber security risks in the same economic terms
as other enterprise risks [24].
Very few SMB cyber security researchers seem to use
mixed methods [25], [84]. Rawindaran et al. researched cyber
security technology using mixed methods to study the adoption of machine learning cyber security in SMBs. Although
most researchers adopted qualitative approaches in their studies [8], [9], [15], [16], [18], [21], [26], [33], [45], [74], [79],
[83], [93], [94], [97], [98], [101], [102], [104], [106], some
adopted quantitative approaches [28], [34], [35], [71], [81],
[82], [86], [95], [99], [100]. For example McLauren adopted
a quantitative approach to study to which extent SMBs should
implement a security framework to offer the most return on
investment [28]. Alharbi et al. [105] also adopted quantitative
methods to measure the impact that SMB cyber security practices have on cyber-attack damage. Their research indicated
that having an inspection team and a recovery plan reduced
the financial damage that a cyber-attack had on SMBs in
Saudi Arabia.
FIGURE 9. Data collection methods used by researchers. The figure shows
the findings that literature reviews are the leading method for data
collection by SMB cyber security researchers.
F. DATA COLLECTION METHODS USED
The data collection methods (Table 2 ) used by researchers
were analysed and our results in Fig. 9 show that literature
reviews were the most common method for data collection
used by researchers (43%), followed by surveys (25%) and
interviews (17%). A combination of methods was used for
7% of the research analysed with the methods least used being
questionnaires (5%) and experiments (3%). It is interesting to
note that none of the publications analysed used observation
as a data gathering method. We believe this is due to the complexity of observing user interactions with computer systems
and user behaviour profiling which requires capturing large
amounts of data, in a process that can be intrusive [110]. With
emergence of automated tools, this may however be more
feasible in the future [111].
VII. DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Many researchers of SMB cyber security use literature
reviews for data collection whilst using largely qualitative
methods. This indicates that there is limited original research
in the field, such as case studies, surveys and experiments
(all which can employ different data collection techniques
including questionnaires, interviews, content analysis, observations [112]). While original field research is difficult in
this highly sensitive area, it would be highly desirable to
better understand the issues and provide better solutions.
A literature-review-based approach also presents a challenge
VOLUME 10, 2022 85713
A. Chidukwani et al.: Survey on the Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses
to researchers when there is limited literature particularly in
localised contexts such as in Australia.
Whilst qualitative methods are quick and cost-effective in
prioritising cyber risks, Alahmari noted the need for empirical
research on topics like cyber security risk management in
SMBs [16]. Well-established and powerful quantitative methods can be used [113], however authors such as Edgar and
Manz argue that the unavailability of objective data limits
their applicability and credibility [114], [115]. Apart from a
lack of data, the limited use of quantitative methods may also
indicate a lack of maturity of research as quantitative methods
are typically used to answer clear, predefined questions in the
advanced stages of a study [116].
Despite the increase in SMB cyber security-related publications over recent years, several authors have suggested
that more research is needed to understand the approaches to
risk management SMBs undertake alongside their responses
to cyber security threats. Such research will help highlight
SMB cyber security activities for preparedness, the decision
makers’ perceptions of risk and approaches to improve their
cyber security postures [70], [88].
Cyber-attacks are now moving beyond data breaches and
privacy concerns to more sophisticated schemes, such as ransomware, that prove very costly, disrupting entire businesses,
industries, supply chains and even nations. Some researchers
such as Baskerville et al. have recommended strategies to
ensure a balanced approach to the prevention and response
paradigms of security [117]. However, many organisations
narrowly focus on technology defences and prevention of
cyber risk but neglect other cyber resilience building activities
like assessments, risk transfer, response planning and training [24].
Very few papers analysed in this study touched on aspects
of SMB cyber security related to the security incident management and business continuity management categories of
the NIST CSF. Since the threats will always be there, whether
external or internal, cyber security risks cannot be eliminated, but a business can mitigate, manage, and recover from
cyber-attacks [69]. SMBs should not only be able to defend
against cyber-attacks in the first instance but also to return
to normal operations after an incident. Eilts [118] found
that small businesses that were able to improve their cyber
security posture were those that had committed to incorporating cyber security preparedness activities into their routine
business.
Although suggested priorities may differ, there is consensus in the literature on what is good cyber security. Bryan
[61] points out that a reliable and affordable starting point to
good cyber security for SMBs is a comprehensive information security system which contains a computer-use policy,
information security training and business virus and malware
protection [86]. Kaila and Urpo [94] suggest the useful first
steps for start-ups and SMBs should be: identifying assets and
risks; protecting accounts, systems, clouds, and data; implementing a continuity plan; and monitoring and reviewing.
Other researchers suggested SMBs should put more focus on
practices that can decrease the impact of cyber-attacks such
as investing in an inspection team and a documented recovery
plan [105]. It is not only the SMB’s responsibility, but also
technology vendors who have been challenged to incorporate
security into computing technologies to assist the likes of
SMBs with limited knowledge and access to expertise [26].
There are security responsibilities for both vendor and SMB
customer, for example for cloud-based Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS).
Table 4 below sums up the practices that are recommended
by researchers [15], [21], [24], [25], [28], [30], [33], [34],
[35], [36], [47], [59], [75], [81], [86], [94], [96], [119], [120],
[121], [122]. Practical implementation of these practices is
somewhat difficult for SMBs, which is why authors like
Carias and Borges proposed a framework for the implementation order of these practices [18].

VIII. CONCLUSION
Continuous on-going research is required to support the
development of cyber security solutions for SMBs [15],
[102]. Research in cyber security is however rarely focussed
on SMBs, despite them representing a large proportion of
business. SMBs contribute immensely to the global economy, and in particular in Australia they make up 98% of
all businesses contributing one third of the GDP. Despite
their large number and importance, our study shows that
research in SMB cyber security is rather limited and narrowly
focussed. This is consistent with previous findings of other
researchers [15].
We also found SMB cyber security research to be concentrated in the USA despite other nations having similar
high proportions of SMBs and facing similar threats but in
different environments. This is in part due to our study only
including English publications, but it may also indicate that
not enough attention is being paid to SMB cyber security in
many countries, despite SMBs representing the backbone of
the nations and the global economy.
Our results show that significant attention and effort has
been made towards research around security strategies and
policies for SMBs, however there appears to be only limited
work in the areas of practical implementation, detection,
response and recovery.
Researchers have recommended that a deeper analysis of
how SMBs implement security controls is required [28]. Our
study found a lack of quantitative data in SMB cyber security research. In future work researchers should adopt more
powerful well-established quantitative research approaches to
investigate SMB cyber security.
When considering the popular NIST CSF, our study found
that research related to the cyber security of SMBs is focussed
on aspects of information security policies and operational
security. Topics relating to cyber security incident detection,
response and recovery are hardly accounted for in past and
current research. In Australia, 62% of small businesses have
been a victim of a cyber-attack [11]. Given that past research
has been mainly directed towards the prevention paradigms,
researchers need to focus their work more on cyber resilience
in order to ensure a more balanced approach to cyber prevention, response and recovery. Globally, governments should
invest in incentivising research and initiatives to promote the
resilience of SMBs. Cyber-attacks are inevitable, but when
they do happen, SMBs should be able to respond and recover.
There is a need for governments and academic institutions
to incentivise researchers to conduct more studies into SMB
cyber security. The findings of our work can be used as
guidance for researchers, academic and research institutions,
governments and policy makers when selecting the focus of
SMB cyber security research.
