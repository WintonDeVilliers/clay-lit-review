# Literature Review: A Continent-Wide Assessment of Cyber Vulnerability Across Africa

## Introduction

The increasing internet penetration rate in Africa has led to a rapid growth in the use of Internet of Things
(IoT) devices. However, this growth also brings about an increase in cyber vulnerabilities and the risk of
cyberattacks on these vulnerable devices. It is essential to assess the cyber vulnerability across Africa to
understand the extent of this threat and take appropriate measures to mitigate it. This literature review
aims to provide an assessment of cyber vulnerability in Africa by analyzing the findings from various
research studies.

## Research Finding: South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries most

susceptible to cyberattack in Africa
According to Al-garadi et al. (2018), a survey of machine and deep learning methods for IoT security,
South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries in Africa that are most
susceptible to cyberattacks. These findings highlight the critical need for cybersecurity measures in these
countries to protect IoT devices and mitigate the risks associated with cyber threats.

## Analysis and Synthesis

The research finding by Al-garadi et al. (2018) provides valuable insights into the cyber vulnerability
across Africa. By identifying the five most susceptible countries, it emphasizes the need for targeted
cybersecurity efforts in these regions. These findings also suggest that these countries may have higher
rates of IoT device usage and internet connectivity, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.
Furthermore, the study by Al-garadi et al. (2018) does not provide specific details about the vulnerabilities
or the factors that contribute to the susceptibility of these countries. Therefore, further research is
required to understand the underlying reasons for their vulnerability. This can help identify the gaps in
cybersecurity infrastructure, policies, or practices that need to be addressed to enhance cyber resilience
in these countries.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While Al-garadi et al. (2018) shed light on the vulnerability of certain countries in Africa, there are
still several knowledge gaps and potential future research directions that can contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of cyber vulnerability across the continent.

1. **Comprehensive assessment of cyber vulnerability**: The research finding focuses on the vulnerability of specific countries. However, a more comprehensive assessment of cyber vulnerability
   across the entire African continent would provide a broader perspective. This assessment could involve
   evaluating various factors such as cybersecurity infrastructure, legislation, awareness, and the prevalence
   of cyberattacks in different regions.
2. **Identification of specific IoT vulnerabilities**: Understanding the specific vulnerabilities of IoT
   devices in Africa can help develop targeted strategies to address them. Future research should focus
   on identifying the common vulnerabilities present in IoT devices across the continent, such as weak
   authentication mechanisms, unpatched software or firmware, and lack of encryption protocols.
3. **Evaluation of cybersecurity policies and practices**: Assessing the existing cybersecurity policies
   and practices in African countries can help identify gaps and areas for improvement. Future research
   should investigate the effectiveness of current policies and practices in mitigating cyber threats and
   propose recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity measures.
4. **Cybersecurity capacity building**: Building cybersecurity capacity is crucial for addressing cyber
   vulnerabilities across Africa. Future research should explore strategies for enhancing cybersecurity
   skills, knowledge, and awareness among individuals, organizations, and governments in the continent.
   This can include the development of training programs, educational initiatives, and collaborations with
   international cybersecurity organizations.
5. **Collaboration and information sharing**: Collaboration and information sharing among African
   countries can significantly contribute to improving cyber resilience. Future research should explore
   mechanisms for facilitating collaboration, such as the establishment of regional cybersecurity centers,
   information sharing platforms, and joint cybersecurity exercises.
   By addressing these knowledge gaps and pursuing these future research directions, we can develop a
   more comprehensive understanding of cyber vulnerability across Africa. This knowledge can guide the
   development and implementation of effective cybersecurity measures to safeguard IoT devices and protect
   African cyberspace from cyberattacks.

## Conclusion

This literature review provides an assessment of cyber vulnerability across Africa based on the research
finding that South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries most susceptible to
cyberattacks. The review highlights the need for targeted cybersecurity efforts in these countries and identifies knowledge gaps and potential future research directions for a more comprehensive understanding

of cyber vulnerability in Africa. By addressing these gaps and pursuing future research, we can enhance
cyber resilience and protect IoT devices in African cyberspace.
