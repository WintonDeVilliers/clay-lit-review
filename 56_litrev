# Literature Review: Technological Forecasting & Social Change 188 (2023) 122265

## Abstract

The integration of sustainability and Industry 4.0 is a crucial aspect of industrial innovation and development. However, few studies have empirically examined the relationship between these two concepts.
This literature review aims to explore the interplay between sustainability and Industry 4.0 by analyzing
a diverse range of research findings. By utilizing a mixed human-artificial intelligence method, this study
examines 1501 sustainability reports. The review synthesizes the provided research insights and identifies
knowledge gaps in the current understanding of the intertwined nature of sustainability and Industry 4.0.
Additionally, it suggests potential future research directions to further explore and enhance the relationship
between these two concepts.

## Introduction

Industry 4.0, characterized by the integration of digital technologies and cyber-physical systems, has
emerged as a significant driver of industrial innovation and sustainability [Pirouz et al., 2020]. However,
there is a lack of empirical research that explores how Industry 4.0 acts as a binding force for both business
practices [Pirouz et al., 2020]. This literature review aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing and analyzing
a collection of research findings that provide insights into the intertwining of sustainability and Industry
4.0. By examining 1501 sustainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method, this
review seeks to shed light on the relationship between these two concepts and identify areas for further
research.
