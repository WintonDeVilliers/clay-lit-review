# Literature Review: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Organisational Cyber Security

## Introduction

In today's digital era, organisations are increasingly relying on modern technologies to enhance their
operations and gain a competitive edge. However, this increased reliance on technology also brings about
a higher risk of cyber security threats. As a result, organisations are actively seeking ways to mitigate
these risks and protect their sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
cyber attacks. One emerging approach that has gained significant attention in recent years is the use of
artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber security. This literature review aims to explore the impact of AI on
organisational cyber security by synthesizing key research findings from relevant studies.

## AI-Based Cyber Security Intrusion Detection

One aspect of cyber security where AI has shown promise is in intrusion detection. Intrusion detection
systems (IDS) play a crucial role in identifying and responding to potential cyber attacks. Traditional IDS
rely on predefined rules and signatures to detect known attack patterns. However, these systems often
struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To address this limitation, researchers
have proposed the use of machine learning algorithms in IDS to enhance their effectiveness and accuracy.
Sarker et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review to explore the impact of AI on cyber security
intrusion detection. They developed a machine learning-based IDS called IntruDTree, which demonstrated
promising results in detecting cyber security intrusions. IntruDTree utilizes decision tree algorithms
to analyze network traffic data and identify anomalous patterns associated with potential attacks. The
researchers found that IntruDTree achieved higher detection rates and lower false positive rates compared
to traditional rule-based IDS.
This finding suggests that AI-based intrusion detection systems can significantly enhance an organization's ability to detect and respond to cyber attacks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, IDS can
adapt and learn from new attack patterns, thereby improving their effectiveness in detecting previously
unknown threats. However, further research is needed to evaluate the scalability and performance of
AI-based IDS in large-scale enterprise environments.

## AI-Powered Chatbots for Enhancing Cyber Security in Healthcare

Another domain where AI has made significant contributions to cyber security is in the healthcare sector.
With the increasing digitization of patient records and the adoption of telehealth services, healthcare
organizations are facing growing challenges in protecting sensitive patient data from cyber threats.
AI-powered chatbots have emerged as a potential solution to enhance cyber security in healthcare by
providing real-time support and threat detection.
Xu et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review to explore the use of AI and machine learning in chatbots
for healthcare and oncology applications. They found that AI-powered chatbots have the potential to
improve cyber security in healthcare by offering personalized education and guidance to users, monitoring
for suspicious activities, and providing real-time alerts in case of potential security breaches. These
chatbots can also assist healthcare professionals in identifying and responding to cyber threats more
efficiently.
The research findings suggest that AI-powered chatbots can serve as an effective tool in enhancing cyber
security in healthcare organizations. By leveraging AI and machine learning capabilities, these chatbots
can contribute to the early detection and prevention of cyber attacks, thereby ensuring the privacy and
confidentiality of patient data. However, further research is needed to evaluate the ethical implications
and potential biases associated with AI-powered chatbots in healthcare settings.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing research provides valuable insights into the impact of AI on organisational cyber
security, there are still several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Firstly, most studies focus on
specific applications of AI in cyber security, such as intrusion detection or chatbots in healthcare. Further
research is needed to explore the broader implications of AI in different domains and industries.
Secondly, the scalability and performance of AI-based cyber security solutions in large-scale enterprise
environments require further investigation. Most studies have evaluated the effectiveness of AI algorithms
in controlled settings or small-scale deployments. Future research should aim to assess the feasibility and
practicality of implementing AI-based solutions in complex organizational settings.
Additionally, the ethical considerations and potential biases associated with AI in cyber security warrant
further exploration. AI algorithms are susceptible to biases and may inadvertently discriminate against
certain individuals or groups. Future research should focus on developing robust and unbiased AI models
that ensure fairness and equality in cyber security practices.

Lastly, the evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates continuous research and development in AI-based
cyber security. As attackers become more sophisticated, it is crucial to stay ahead of emerging threats by
constantly updating and refining AI algorithms and models.
In conclusion, the integration of AI in organisational cyber security has the potential to significantly enhance an organization's ability to detect and respond to cyber threats. The research findings highlighted the
effectiveness of AI-based intrusion detection systems and AI-powered chatbots in healthcare. However,
there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, including exploring the broader implications of AI
in different domains, evaluating scalability and performance, addressing ethical considerations and biases,
and staying ahead of emerging threats through continuous research and development. By addressing these
gaps, organizations can harness the full potential of AI to strengthen their cyber security posture and
protect their valuable assets.
