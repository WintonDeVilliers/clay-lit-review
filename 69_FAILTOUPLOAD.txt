ABSTRACT
Cybersecurity is increasingly a concern for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), and there exist many awareness training
programs and tools for them. The literature mainly studies SMEs
as a unitary type of company and provides one-size-fits-all
recommendations and solutions. However, SMEs are not
homogeneous. They are diverse with different vulnerabilities,
cybersecurity needs, and competencies. Few studies considered
such differences in standards and certificates for security tools
adoption and cybersecurity tailoring for these SMEs.
This study proposes a classification framework with an outline of
cybersecurity improvement needs for each class. The framework
suggests five SME types based on their characteristics and
specific security needs: cybersecurity abandoned SME, unskilled
SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and cybersecurity
provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the study
explains the framework’s usage in sampled SMEs. The
framework proposes solutions for each class to approach
cybersecurity awareness and competence more consistent with
SME needs.

1 Introduction
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are perceived to have
the weakest defences against cyber-attacks [1, 2]. Many SMEs are
often unaware of cybersecurity’s significance, and the lack of
adoption of precautions is a real risk [1, 3].
Diverse solutions proposed to provide training for awareness
and cybersecurity capability improvement for SMEs. A vast
amount of security advice is available [1]. ENISA developed
training for raising awareness [4]. Other work described
information security maturity assessments [5, 6], self-paced tools
for training awareness improvement [e.g., 7, 8, 9], and
information security management approaches [10, 11]. However,
a report from Pnemon Institute [12] shows an increase in
sophisticated cyber-attack against SMEs. A recent report from
Hiscox [35] demonstrates a sharp increase in reported cyberattacks among SMEs across UK, Europe, and the US. Many
SMEs still lack awareness or do not adopt any of these solutions.
One of the reasons for the lack of adoption may be that each of
these approaches may fit some SMEs but not others.
SMEs are heterogeneous exhibit diverse cybersecurity needs,
perceptions, and capabilities [13, 14]. For example, SMEs might
have different Information System (IS) expertise, various
cybersecurity self-efficacy, and diverse appreciation of
cybersecurity threats [3, 18, 36, 37]. This diversity indicates that
there is no one-size-fits-all. Consistency of security information
with the target group’s profile, including demographic factors, is
imperative for delivering security content [1, 3, 15, 16, 17]. For
example, the cybersecurity level of target audiences is vital to
ensuring a cybersecurity program’s success [15]. However, few
studies have considered SMEs’ differences and how to
communicate and approach cybersecurity in a tailored manner [3,
18, 36]. Study [3] focuses only on cybersecurity standards and
certification schemes adoption. Study [18] considers only two
SME types, and [36] only studies individuals’ risk perceptions and
security management practices.
This study aims at addressing the heterogeneity problem with a
classification framework. It distinguishes between categories of
SMEs based on their characteristics. The characteristics include
SME staff IT knowledge, cybersecurity offering, cybersecurity
expertise in SME, awareness of threats and the importance of
protection, awareness of good practices, and awareness of the
dynamic essence of cybersecurity.
Classification framework is of vital importance since it reduces
the complexity of approaching cybersecurity improvement by
identifying security improvement needs for each class. The
framework indicates that each type of SME needs a specific
approach to be well protected. Therefore, instead of providing
inefficient general recommendations and training content,
cybersecurity communications effectively target each SME class.
The study identified five types of SMEs, including cybersecurity
provider, capable, expert-connected, unskilled, and abandoned
SMEs. We argue that the classification can offer a significant
contribution to the SME cybersecurity literature because SME
classification has not yet been adequately served.
The remainder of this study is organised as follows. Section 2
presents the background of the research; section 3 outlines the
classification framework for approaching cybersecurity
improvement; section 4 explains the use of the framework in
sampled SMEs; section 5 discusses the significance of the 
Shojaifar and Järvinen
framework and future research avenues. Section 6 summarises
and concludes.
2 Research Background
Classification is significant since it decreases the complexity of
working with various entities with different features and reduces
the amount of information we need to store [19, 20]. Defining
concepts is important since “if we perceived each entity as unique,
we would be overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of what we
experience and unable to remember more than a minute fraction
of what we encounter” [20]. Based on Smith and Medin [20],
concepts allow us to go beyond the information given. When we
assign an entity to a class on the basis of its perceptible attributes,
we can infer some of its non-perceptible attributes. Category
knowledge helps to make inferences about the presence of
unobserved or unobservable features [19, 21].
Rosch [19] proposes two fundamental principles for
classification: cognitive economy and perceived world structure.
The cognitive economy refers to category systems’ functions and
indicates that category systems need to “provide maximum
information with the least cognitive effort.” Perceived world
structure refers to the structure of the information so provided and
indicates that “the perceived world comes as structured
information rather than as arbitrary or unpredictable attributes.”
Therefore, “maximum information with least cognitive effort is
achieved if categories map the perceived world structure as
closely as possible.”
Prior research considered SME classes in business and the
characteristics in which SMEs differ widely from one another.
Chua et al. [13] indicate that the characteristics of SME ownermanagers, the aspects of the firm and its employees, and the
characteristics of the environment in which they operate impact
SME heterogeneity. Hagen et al. [22] provide evidence and
introduce four distinct SME profiles and strategic business
patterns.
Digital SME Alliance [3] highlights the importance of the
analysis of different types of SMEs’ cybersecurity requirements
and consequently adapting the measures for effective
cybersecurity adoption. Furthermore, the study based on Interim
Report [23] confirms the impact of industry type and firm size on
cybersecurity adoption. They identify four types of SMEs and
their role in the digital ecosystem to tailor security standards:
• Digital enablers are SMEs that are active in developing and
providing cybersecurity solutions.
• Digitally based are SMEs that cybersecurity is not the core of
their business; however, they highly depend on digital and
security solutions from the first category to ensure their
business continuity.
• Digitally dependent are end-user SMEs that form the largest
category of SMEs. They use regular ICT for running their
businesses, and they need to access easily understandable
and practical solutions.
• Start-ups are SMEs that security has a low priority since they
are busy with the functional development of their business
models. They need to understand the importance of security
compliances and be motivated to adopt security standards.
Lee and Larsen [18] consider anti-malware software adoption
in SMEs through a survey study. Their study indicates two types
of SMEs (IT-intensive industries, non-IT intensive industries) and
two types of SME executives (IS experts, non-IS experts). The
study emphasises that vendor support, including the presence of
designated technicians, easy access to technical assistance, 24 × 7
services, and periodic training, is a key facilitator in persuading
executives to adopt security solutions. While the study explains
the impact of industry type on adoption decision, it does not
indicate a significant effect of the firm size on the adoption
intention and actual adoption. Moreover, the study based on
Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) [24] explains that SME
executives’ IS self-efficacy strongly influences cybersecurity
adoption decisions.
Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies demonstrate
individuals’ perception of capabilities and capacities to perform
specific required tasks successfully [25]. Self-efficacy is a
motivational construct that influences individuals’ initial choice of
activities, goals, task engagement, and affective reactions to tasks.
Moreover, it is a dynamic construct that can be changed due to
learning, experience, and feedback [26].
Information system (IS) research has considered self-efficacy
as a fundamental determinant of IS usage [27]. Organisational
supports, including top management encouragement, impact
employees’ self-efficacy and IS usage [28]. Furthermore, since
efficacy beliefs are situationally specific [27, 29], others have
considered cybersecurity self-efficacy and used instruments to
measure cybersecurity efficacy and skills [e.g., 30]. Competence
in cybersecurity can be explained based on self-efficacy [30].
Classifying SMEs for Approaching Cybersecurity
Collective self-efficacy focuses on employees’ aggregated
capabilities instead of individual-focused and assessed by
organisational representatives [18, 31]. SME executives or top
managers are identified as individuals who can adequately assess
their companies’ collective self-efficacy. Also, their self-efficacy
impact cybersecurity adoption in SMEs [18].
Bulgurcu et al. [30] indicate that providing organizational
security awareness is an important factor in persuading employees
to adopt security technologies and practices. They distinguish two
types of awareness: general security awareness and information
security policy (ISP) awareness. General security awareness is
defined as an overall understanding of security threats, their
consequences, and the importance of precautions. In addition, ISP
awareness is defined as understanding the requirements prescribed
in the policies and the aims of those requirements. Both types of
awareness can be considered for SMEs.
Although the classification of SMEs is needed to tailor
cybersecurity solutions, little attention has been given to it. Lee
and Larsen [18] consider the importance of self-efficacy and
expertise; however, categorising SMEs into IT-intensive and nonIT-intensive and the executives to expert and non-expert seems
insufficient. DIGITAL SME [3] classifies SMEs to better adapt
standards and certification schemes to the needs of SMEs in short
to medium-term; however, the study explains that for the longterm goal, a mix of raising awareness and providing practical
solutions is needed.

Shojaifar and Järvinen
We now move to the classification framework to draw out
approaching cybersecurity awareness-raising and capability
improvement in various types of SMEs.
3 An SME Classification Framework for
Approaching Cybersecurity Awareness
This section proposes a classification framework of five SME
types and indicates cybersecurity improvement needs for each
class (Table 1). The framework resulted from the paper design
author experience with SMEs of six EU countries over several
years on two projects. Iterative design security solutions for
SMEs, using the design science research methodology [45],
provided us the opportunity to learn more about SMEs and their
differences. The concepts (classes) were defined to reflect
maximum information about the SME characteristics and
cybersecurity competence with the least cognitive effort to
distinguish between the classes.
The following factors have been considered in the
classification. The factors provide a minimal set, mutually
independent to reflect competence and awareness in SMEs.
• SME with cybersecurity offering (CSO). The SME can be a
cybersecurity provider company.
• Staff and CEO with cybersecurity expertise or in active
contact with a cybersecurity expert (CSEA). The SME may
have sufficient proficiency in cybersecurity or have
internal/external CISO that support cybersecurity activities in
the company or have no security expertise and connection to
a security expert.
• Staff and CEO with in-depth IT user Expertise (ITE). The
SME staff can have sufficient IT expertise or receive
technical support from available resources.
• Staff and CEO with awareness about cyber threats and the
importance of protection (CSTA). This factor reflects the
SME staff’s general perception of cybersecurity risks and the
importance of implementing countermeasures.
• Staff and CEO with awareness of SME-expected good
cybersecurity practice (CSGP). This factor reflects SME staff
and CEO’s understanding of the importance of guidelines
and policies and the availability of a written policy in the
company. The SME may have an explicit security guideline
or policy statement in place according to the SME security
requirements, or partially written for some focus areas, or no
clear policy or guideline statement.
• CEO or CISO with awareness of the dynamic character of
cybersecurity (CSAD). The SME approaches in
cybersecurity can differ. If they realise that cybersecurity
becomes obsolete, they may have a long-term attitude to plan
updated training and review their policies. If they look at the
awareness topics as secondary issues, they try to adopt
security solutions to gain a security level. If they have no
clear perception of potential threats and vulnerabilities, they
are reluctant to adopt cybersecurity solutions.
According to the SME types, the approach of cybersecurity
improvement needs to be adapted. Thus, the training awareness
content or hands-on solutions would be more meaningful for
SMEs. Five proposed classes are:
Cybersecurity Abandoned SMEs. In this type, SMEs have no
cybersecurity policy or guideline. Along with a lack of security
competence, IT skill shortages seem to constrain cybersecurity
activities. They have no resource allocation or connection to
cybersecurity resources. They have no clear perception of security
threats; consequently, they do not see the need for security
measures or commitment to cybersecurity practices. Providing
extrinsic motivation to adopt security solutions and change
incorrect beliefs about its true threat exposure is a significant need
for this class.
Moreover, they need access to basic security and IT
knowledge, hands-on skills, and training content to improve their
capabilities. Further, connection to trusted security experts and
peers for communication seems necessary. It can facilitate
security controls implementation and knowledge transfer.
Cybersecurity Unskilled SMEs. In this type, SMEs have a
partially written cybersecurity policy for some focus areas. They
are aware of some security threats and vulnerabilities; however,
they do not have a holistic view. They have a lack of
cybersecurity skills. They are not connected to experts, third
parties, or associations to exchange knowledge and develop their
employees’ skills, and therefore they lack the competence to
manage cybersecurity measures. They realise the importance of
cybersecurity measures and are willing to comply with security
policies. Thus, access to hands-on security skills, training content,
and cybersecurity experts can lead them to improve their
capabilities and adopt security solutions.
Cybersecurity Expert-connected SMEs. This type of SME
has a partially written policy for some focus areas. They are
connected and dependent on trusted third parties or have a CISO
to manage their cybersecurity measures. They are aware of the
importance of cybersecurity, and they have a connection to gain
knowledge and skills. The employees are not adequately skilled in
cybersecurity; in turn, access to specific capabilities and training
based on their business model can fill the cybersecurity gaps for
protecting the SME.
Cybersecurity Capable SMEs. This type of SME has a
cybersecurity culture and a written security policy fully aligned
with what cybersecurity must be done, the same as the
cybersecurity provider SMEs (the next class). However, the key
differentiator between this type and security provider SMEs is
their business model. They have expertise and proficiency in IT
and cybersecurity. Access to the updated and newest
cybersecurity and IT technologies material to adapt their
protection approaches holds useful for this type. Also, access to
cybersecurity news helps them maintain awareness about
incidents and changes in the threat landscape.
Cybersecurity Provider SMEs. They provide security
solutions for others. This type of SME has a cybersecurity culture
and a written security policy the same as the capable SMEs (the
previous class). They are aware that threats are ever-changing, so
they regularly review their policy and updates their rules.
Moreover, they have a plan to update their training for employees.
Classifying SMEs for Approaching Cybersecurity
Thus, this type best demonstrates having a proactive attitude about
cybersecurity activities. The same as cybersecurity-capable SMEs,
their paramount cybersecurity need is access to the newest
cybersecurity and IT technologies material and news (e.g., new
policies, compromised websites).
4 The Use of the Framework
This section presents the early validation of the framework to
provide evidence on the use and usefulness of the solution. The
results are based on the first author qualitative study, interview,
with five sampled SMEs (project partners). The participating
SMEs have different sizes (micro, small, and medium) and are
active in various industries. The selection of the subjects was
based on their availability and their cybersecurity competence and
experience level. This is an exemplar section to illustrate one
example for each class of SME. This approach has been
confirmed by [44].
SME-1 is a micro-enterprise active in hair and beauty. The
subject demonstrated no expertise in IT and cybersecurity. She
was unaware of how a phishing attack can impact her business
and her customers’ data. Moreover, she did not know whom she
should contact when an incident happens. Interestingly, she
explained that:
“I rank rather high my company security level.”
Further, she did not indicate any specific security need. It seems
she does not have a correct perception of cybersecurity threats.
According to the framework, the SME executive has the lowest
level of self-efficacy; abandoned SME. Therefore, basic training
for security awareness, cybersecurity motivation for implementing
relevant security control, and supporting a connection to security
and IT experts seem necessary.
SME-2 is a small company active in the IT industry. The
subject was willing to improve the SME’s cybersecurity, and the
company has a partially written policy for password management.
However, the subject was unable to manage security measures and
find relevant resources. The subject noted:
“We do not have a security team department. If you do not
have a CISO, [you need] offers [for] training classes and
certification. We need delivery of services.” Furthermore, the
subject stated: “We need to know how to solve the problems
and not only presenting the problems.”
According to the framework, it is an unskilled cybersecurity
SME. Access to hands-on resources, training courses, and
cybersecurity experts seems necessary.
SME-3 is a micro health care company. The subject indicated
specific training awareness requirements based on the company
business model. He further explained that:
“[general training content] is not applicable to us, the
hardware that we use for the services is managed by third
parties, and they also set up the network. We need training
content about cloud services for training the employees.”
According to the framework, it is a cybersecurity expertconnected SME. A third party is responsible for managing their
cybersecurity measures. Although the SME staff are aware of
potential security threats, they do not have enough cybersecurity
competence according to their business model. Access to specific
training awareness content congruent with their business model
seems useful.
SME-4 is a medium-sized company active in electronic voting
technologies. The company has a security department as well as a
written policy. The subject noted that:
“Access to material for more advanced security controls such
as trusted boot or hardware encryption or a list of the latest
threats and vulnerabilities is useful [for us].”
According to the framework, it is a cybersecurity capable
SME. Access to the latest updates and advanced security controls
seems useful.
SME-5 is a small company active in cybersecurity. The
company provides security solutions and advice to other firms.
The company has a written policy in place and puts a high value
on review and update security measures. The subject indicated
that:
“We review our policy two or three times a year. Having the
most recent updates and news are useful to review.”
According to the framework, it is a cybersecurity provider
SME. The company staff has great cybersecurity competence, and
the same as the cybersecurity-capable SMEs, access to the latest
updates in cybersecurity and IT seems useful.
5 Discussion
The contribution of this study is proposing an SME classification
framework and indicating cybersecurity improvement needs for
each SME type. The framework can reduce the complexity of
SME heterogeneity and the lack of security adoption, leading to
targeting more effective cybersecurity competence and awareness.
Commonly studies distinguish between SMEs based on the
number of employees [37, 38, 39]. However, it is not enough to
approach effective cybersecurity in SMEs. In line with [3, 18],
this study demonstrates that classification helps enrich the
understanding of SME types to communicate and keep them
engaged effectively. The classification approach is in contrast
with the idea of CYSFAM [43] that proposes a maturity model for
generic organisations. Moreover, compared to [3, 18] (which
identify four and two types of SMEs, respectively), this study
indicates five types of SMEs with no counterpart for the
cybersecurity capable SMEs.
The proposed framework is not a maturity model, and it does
not convey that one class is more secure or vulnerable than the
others. Instead, it is a taxonomy of distinct SME types and
indicates that each type exhibits different needs to be secured.
Therefore, the framework does not signify that there is a
progression from one class to another one. While there are
predictable reasons for movement between classes, there is no
Shojaifar and Järvinen
necessary sequence between the SME classes. For instance, an
unskilled SME can hire an internal CISO, or an abandoned SME
may establish a connection to a security provider SME and,
consequently, move to the expert-connected class.
SMEs are heavily restricted with the available funding for
cybersecurity purposes [41]; however, cybersecurity projects and
service providers are approaching security in SMEs by developing
cost-effective and lightweight solutions. The framework can help
these service providers understand the level of cybersecurity
expertise and good practices of SMEs in the different categories.
Even more importantly, it shows the need to reach out to the
potential end-users of their solutions with a messaging that
focuses on the improvement needs of each category. The
improvement needs of each category vary greatly, and there is
little overlap. This means that a cybersecurity service provider
must choose between the target audiences or markets it prioritises
when it comes to communications, messaging, and even offering
services and tools. For example, the European Horizon 2020
project GEIGER [42] could specialise first in one of the categories
and focus on capturing its interest with the communications
highlighting its specific improvement needs, and then extend the
services and communications to reach the rest of the groups.
In the context of GEIGER, the key contents of
communications targeted to the different categories could be:
• Abandoned SMEs: raising awareness of the existence and
importance of addressing cybersecurity threats, teaching
basic IT skills and how to evaluate risks, recommendations,
and connecting with experts and tool providers.
• Unskilled SMEs: offering beginner or intermediate level
training packages and connecting with experts (“Digital
Security Defenders”) who can provide concrete support in
implementing the given recommendations.
• Expert-connected SMEs: connecting with experts who can
assist in detecting the remaining weak areas and in
establishing robust good practices for daily operations and
continuous improvement.
• Capable SMEs and provider SMEs: highlighting the features
of the offered tool that allow for continuous monitoring of
and adaptation to the threat landscape and novel tools and
technologies.
To raise the chosen target audience’s interest and convince
them, messaging highlighting their improvement needs should be
consistently implemented throughout all channels. Consistent
security messages affect SMEs’ threat appraisal [1] and motivate
them to implement necessary but straightforward precautions [1,
18, 32]. For example, if choosing to focus on the abandoned
SMEs category, the essential contents of the landing page of the
GEIGER solution could include a catchy and concrete story of a
peer SME who discovered their cybersecurity risks and started
improving them with the help of GEIGER. Also, a short
questionnaire to evaluate their current risks. CEOs in abandoned
SMEs may have incorrect perceptions of their security level and
potential risks. So, they might be demotivated to adopt
cybersecurity solutions. Julisch argues that SMEs may argue
“nobody would want to attack us” [40]. Beliefs and perceptions
affect users’ intention of cybersecurity activities [30].
Furthermore, GEIGER could support abandoned SMEs’ IT skills.
They lack the technical IT expertise, affecting the GEIGER
solution adoption. The lack of IT and computer self-efficacy
impacts security solution adoption [33, 34], and in SMEs is a
significant inhibitor [18].
As the businesses in the categories of abandoned and unskilled
SMEs have low awareness of cybersecurity issues, it is likely to
be most efficient to reach out to them through non-cybersecurityrelated channels that they already follow for professional or
personal purposes. For example, trade or association newsletters
and publications or presence at industry events, as well as direct
contacts through their trusted service providers (such as
accountants) or peer SMEs. The three other categories could, in
addition, be reached through channels and events linked to
cybersecurity.
This solution paper proposed a framework and exemplar
section to apply it based on one sampled SME for each category.
The avenue for future research is to empirically validate the
framework across a broader sample of SMEs using, for instance, a
survey-based quantitative approach studying the diversity of the
SMEs in categories and elaborate their needs in more detail.
Further, future work needs to entail more metrics for SME
classification, for instance, concerning privacy needs, if SMEs
that need to process personal information have active contact with
Data Protection Officer (DPO). However, this study takes its
place among the very few studies in SMEs’ classification for
cybersecurity improvement.
6 Conclusion
The paper has proposed a classification framework to better target
value-ridden cybersecurity improvement in various types of
SMEs. Based on SME characteristics, the framework identified
five SME types: cybersecurity abandoned SME, unskilled SME,
expert-connected SME, capable SME, and provider SME.
Moreover, the framework studied different cybersecurity needs
for approaching security improvement in each class.
Further, the study illustrated the use of the framework in the
sampled SMEs from different industries. The early validation of
the framework demonstrated that the framework could explain the
differences between SME types. Moreover, the subjects identified
some needs that have been considered in the framework. The
security needs constituted a broad diversity. Cybersecurity
unskilled and abandoned SMEs needed to connect to security
experts and access training awareness material. The expertconnected SME mainly required capabilities to fill specific
security gaps, and capable and provider SMEs needed to have
updated and newest cybersecurity and IT technologies material.
The framework aims to demonstrate how each class of SME
can be effectively communicated and well protected and does not
convey that one class is more secure or vulnerable than the others.
Therefore, the framework can help cybersecurity service providers
in that they can position SMEs in one of the classes in the early
face to decide how to communicate and offer services and tools.
