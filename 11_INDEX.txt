INDEX
Notes
Cross-reference terms in italics are general cross-references, or refer to subentry terms within the main entry (the main entry is not
repeated to save space). Readers are also advised to refer to each article for additional cross-references e not all of these crossreferences have been included in the index cross-references.
The index is arranged in set-out style with a maximum of three levels of subheading. Major discussion of a subject is indicated by
bold page numbers. Page numbers suffixed by t, f, and b refer to Tables, Figures, and Boxes respectively. vs. indicates a comparison.
The index entries are presented in word-by-word alphabetical sequence in which a group of letters followed by a space is filed before
the same group of letters followed by a letter. For example, entries beginning ’air density’ are alphabetized before ’aircraft.’ Prefixes
and terms in parentheses are excluded from the initial alphabetization.
