# Literature Review: Cyber-insurance in EU policy-making: Regulatory options, the marketâ€™s challenges

and the US example

## Introduction

The increasing use of digital technologies in our daily lives has brought about numerous benefits but also
exposed us to significant cyber risks. As a result, cyber-insurance has emerged as a viable method for
transferring cyber risks. However, the effectiveness of cyber-insurance in improving network security is
contingent upon various factors, such as the interdependency of cybersecurity efforts and advances in
Internet measurement and machine learning techniques (Woods et al., 2017).

## Impact of Security Interdependency on Contract Design

The interdependent nature of cybersecurity poses challenges for insurers and insureds in designing
effective cyber-insurance contracts. Woods et al. (2017) investigate the impact of security interdependency
on the contract design problem. They demonstrate that security interdependency creates a "profit opportunity" for insurers by exploiting inefficient effort levels of interdependent agents. Insurers can design
contracts that incentivize insureds to increase their effort levels, leading to improved network security
and increased profitability for insurers.

## Role of Pre-Screening and Security Interdependence in Policy Design

Khalili et al. (2018) also explore the role of pre-screening and security interdependence in designing
cyber insurance policies. They highlight the importance of incorporating risk externalities and risk
interdependencies into the policy design process. By utilizing security pre-screening, insurers can design
contracts that encourage insureds to enhance their effort levels, resulting in improved network security
and increased profitability for insurers.

## Symbiotic Relationship between Security Vendors and Cyber-insurance Agencies

To address the profitability challenges faced by network risk management services, Pal and Golubchik
(2010) propose a symbiotic relationship between security vendors and cyber-insurance agencies. They
suggest differentiated security pricing mechanisms that allow security vendors to price differentiate their
clients based on security investment information from insurance agencies. This approach enables security

vendors to increase their profit margins and transfer some of the extra profit to cyber-insurance agencies,
making cyber-insurance services more viable.

## Overview of Maritime Cyber Security Incidents

The maritime industry has witnessed a rapid evolution with the introduction of new technology and
digitization. Wang (2017) provides an overview of maritime cyber security incidents from the past decade.
The study links these incidents to a taxonomy of attack points related to onboard or off-ship systems. The
analysis reveals that maritime cyber threats typically have low frequency but high impact, making them
challenging to predict and prepare for. The study emphasizes the diverse nature of attackers and attack
techniques, indicating the absence of a single solution to mitigate maritime cyber threats.

## Classification of Previous Research in Cyber Insurance

Pal et al. (2016) classify previous research in the area of cyber insurance into four categories: economical
aspects, mathematical models, risk management methodologies, and predictions of cyber events. The
authors identify practical research problems where security experts can contribute by developing new
data-driven methodologies and automated tools to replace existing qualitative approaches in each phase
of the insurance process. This highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance the
effectiveness of cyber-insurance policies.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the provided research findings shed light on various aspects of cyber-insurance in EU policy-making, several knowledge gaps and potential future research directions can be identified:

1. **Regulatory Options**: The literature review lacks specific insights into the regulatory options
   available in EU policy-making for cyber-insurance. Future research could explore the existing regulatory
   frameworks and identify potential gaps or areas for improvement.
2. **Market Challenges**: Although the research findings discuss the challenges faced by the cyber-insurance market, further investigation is needed to understand the specific market dynamics, barriers to
   entry, and competitive landscape.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: The research findings primarily focus on EU policy-making and lack a
   comparative analysis with the US example. Future research could examine the regulatory approaches and
   market dynamics in the US to identify transferable lessons or best practices.

4. **Cyber Risk Assessment**: The literature review briefly mentions the importance of cyber risk
   assessment in cyber-insurance policies. However, more in-depth research is needed to develop robust
   models and frameworks for assessing cyber risks and determining appropriate insurance coverage.
5. **Integration of Machine Learning Techniques**: The research findings highlight the potential of
   integrating machine learning techniques in cyber-insurance. Future studies could explore the specific
   applications of machine learning, such as predictive modeling or anomaly detection, to enhance cyber-insurance policy design and risk management.
6. **IoT-Enabled Industries**: The literature review touches upon the maritime industry, but other
   IoT-enabled industries, such as healthcare or transportation, warrant further investigation. Future research
   could examine the unique cyber risks and insurance challenges associated with these industries.
   In conclusion, the provided research findings contribute to our understanding of cyber-insurance in
   EU policy-making. However, further research is needed to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps
   and pave the way for more effective regulatory options, improved market dynamics, and enhanced risk
   assessment in the field of cyber-insurance.
