# Literature Review: Cyber Security Implementation Challenges for Small-to-Medium Sized Businesses

(SMBs)

## Introduction

Small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) play a significant role in many economies. However, existing
literature suggests that SMBs often fail to adequately implement cybersecurity measures, leaving them
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Despite the prevalence of SMBs, research focused on cybersecurity is largely
directed towards larger organizations. This paper aims to review recent research on the cybersecurity
practices of SMBs, with a specific focus on the alignment of this research with the NIST Cyber
Security Framework (CSF). Additionally, the key challenges faced by SMBs in implementing effective
cybersecurity measures will be discussed, and recommendations for improving cybersecurity practices
among SMBs will be provided.

## Cybersecurity Implementation Challenges for SMBs

The literature reveals several key challenges that SMBs face in implementing good cybersecurity
practices. Buczak and Guven (2016) highlight these challenges, emphasizing the need for effective
cybersecurity intrusion detection. They argue that SMBs face difficulties in detecting and mitigating cyber
threats due to limited resources and expertise. This lack of technical knowledge and skilled personnel
makes it challenging for SMBs to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and proactively address
them (Buczak & Guven, 2016).
In addition to resource limitations, SMBs also face challenges related to the rapidly evolving nature of
cyber threats. Parkinson et al. (2017) mention that autonomous and connected vehicles are particularly
susceptible to cyber threats. While this finding does not directly focus on SMBs, it highlights the broader
issue of emerging cyber threats that may affect SMBs as well. The dynamic nature of cyber threats
necessitates continuous monitoring and adaptation of cybersecurity practices, which can be challenging
for SMBs with limited resources and expertise (Parkinson et al., 2017).
Another challenge faced by SMBs is the increasing prevalence of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks. Bawany, Shamsi, and Salah (2017) discuss the detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks using
Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Although this study does not explicitly address SMBs, it underscores the growing threat landscape and the need for effective cybersecurity measures. SMBs, in particular,

may struggle to protect their networks and infrastructure from these attacks due to limited financial and
technical resources (Bawany et al., 2017).

## Aligning SMB Cybersecurity Practices with the NIST CSF

To assess the alignment of research on SMB cybersecurity with the NIST CSF, the findings from the
reviewed literature are insufficient. Further research is required to examine the extent to which existing
studies align with the framework and identify any gaps. This represents a knowledge gap in the current
literature and suggests a potential avenue for future research.

## Recommendations for Implementing Good Cybersecurity in SMBs

Based on the available research findings, several recommendations can be made to improve cybersecurity
practices among SMBs. First, SMBs should prioritize cybersecurity awareness and education for their
employees. By providing training and raising awareness about potential cyber threats, SMBs can enhance
their overall cybersecurity posture (Buczak & Guven, 2016).
Second, SMBs should consider leveraging emerging technologies, such as deep learning models, to
enhance their cybersecurity capabilities. Roopak, Tian, and Chambers (2019) suggest that deep learning
models can be effective in securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. SMBs can explore the adoption of
such technologies to improve threat detection and response mechanisms (Roopak et al., 2019).
Lastly, SMBs should collaborate with industry associations, government agencies, and other SMBs to
share best practices and exchange information about emerging cyber threats. Such collaboration can help
SMBs overcome resource limitations and stay updated with the latest cybersecurity trends and practices
(Romanosky, 2016).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the literature indicates that SMBs face significant challenges in implementing effective
cybersecurity measures. Limited resources, technical expertise, and the evolving nature of cyber threats
contribute to their vulnerability. To address these challenges, SMBs should prioritize cybersecurity
awareness, leverage emerging technologies, and foster collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Further
research is needed to assess the alignment of existing studies with the NIST CSF and explore additional
strategies for improving cybersecurity practices among SMBs. By implementing these recommendations,
SMBs can enhance their cybersecurity posture and mitigate the risks associated with cyber-attacks.
