# Literature Review: Cyber-security Implications for Australian Small Businesses

## Introduction

Cyber-security has become a critical concern for organizations of all sizes, including small businesses.
Small businesses, which employ a significant proportion of the workforce, are increasingly becoming
attractive targets for cyber-criminals. However, small businesses struggle to implement cyber-security
measures that are routinely deployed by larger organizations. This literature review aims to explore the
challenges faced by small businesses in implementing cyber-security measures and highlight the gaps in
current research and products in the Australian context.

## Cyber-security Challenges for Small Businesses

Small businesses face unique challenges in implementing effective cyber-security measures. Tam et al.
(2021) emphasize that small businesses struggle to implement cyber-security measures that are routinely
deployed by larger organizations. This puts them at a higher risk of cyber-attacks. The authors argue
that small businesses lack the necessary resources, expertise, and awareness to effectively address
cyber-security concerns.
Ludwig et al. (2018) further highlight the socio-technical challenges faced by small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) within the context of Industry 4.0. The authors argue that SMEs often lack the
necessary knowledge and skills to understand and address cyber-security risks associated with emerging
technologies. This lack of awareness and expertise further exacerbates the cyber-security challenges faced
by small businesses.

## Relevance to Australian Small Businesses

The cyber-security challenges faced by small businesses are not limited to a specific geographical context.
However, it is important to understand these challenges within the Australian context. Tam et al. (2021)
contextualize the cyber-security implications for Australian small businesses. They argue that small
businesses in Australia struggle to implement cyber-security measures due to various factors such as
limited resources, lack of awareness, and inadequate support structures.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Despite the growing importance of cyber-security for small businesses, there are several knowledge gaps
that need to be addressed through future research. The following research insights highlight potential
areas for further investigation:

1. Integration of social and IoT technologies: Mendhurwar and Mishra (2019) discuss the architectural
   framework for digital transformation and the challenges associated with integrating social and IoT
   technologies. This insight suggests the need for research on the cyber-security implications of integrating
   these technologies in the context of small businesses.
2. Utilizing blockchain to overcome cyber-security concerns in IoT: Alotaibi (2019) reviews the use of
   blockchain technology to address cyber-security concerns in the Internet of Things (IoT). This insight
   calls for further research on the applicability of blockchain in enhancing the cyber-security posture of
   small businesses in Australia.
3. Cyber security in the maritime industry: Farah et al. (2022) conduct a systematic survey of recent
   advances and future trends in cyber-security in the maritime industry. This insight suggests the need for
   research on the specific cyber-security challenges faced by small businesses operating in the maritime
   sector in Australia.
4. Generalized FDIA-based cyber topology attack: Liang et al. (2018) propose a generalized cyber
   topology attack with application to the Australian electricity market trading mechanism. This insight highlights the importance of understanding specific cyber-security threats and attacks relevant to Australian
   small businesses.
   By addressing these knowledge gaps, future research can contribute to the development of effective and
   suitable cyber-security solutions for Australian small businesses.

## Conclusion

Small businesses in Australia face significant challenges in implementing effective cyber-security measures. These challenges arise due to limited resources, lack of awareness, and inadequate support
structures. The existing literature highlights the need for further research on integrating social and
IoT technologies, utilizing blockchain for cyber-security, and addressing cyber-security concerns in the
maritime industry. By addressing these knowledge gaps, future research can provide valuable insights into
cyber-security implications for Australian small businesses and contribute to the development of effective
solutions.
