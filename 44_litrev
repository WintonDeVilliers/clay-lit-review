# Literature Review: The Regulatory Framework for the Protection of Critical Infrastructures against

Cyberthreats: Identifying Shortcomings and Addressing Future Challenges: The Case of the Health Sector
in Particular

## Introduction

The protection of critical infrastructures against cyberthreats has become a significant concern at both
national and EU levels. With the evolution of the concept of "Critical Infrastructures," it is essential to
address the current challenges and respond to emerging concerns, particularly in terms of cybersecurity
and resilience. This literature review aims to examine the regulatory framework for protecting critical
infrastructures, with a specific focus on the health sector. The review will integrate and synthesize the
research findings, highlight knowledge gaps, and suggest potential future research directions.

## Cybersecurity in the Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Sector

The connected and autonomous vehicle sector faces numerous vulnerabilities and cyber threats, making
it crucial to address cybersecurity risks effectively. However, existing studies in this area primarily
adopt a reactive approach, often identifying vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques through friendly
adversaries. These studies highlight the need for proactive measures and a comprehensive understanding
of the sector's vulnerabilities to minimize future cybersecurity risks (Wilson et al., 2016).

## Shortcomings in the Regulatory Framework

While the protection of critical infrastructures against cyberthreats has gained significant attention, there
are several shortcomings in the existing regulatory framework. These shortcomings hinder the effective
defense against cyberattacks in the health sector, thereby leaving critical infrastructures vulnerable.

### Lack of Comprehensive Risk Assessment

One of the key shortcomings in the regulatory framework is the lack of a comprehensive risk assessment
approach. Effective protection against cyberthreats requires a thorough understanding of the risks associated with critical infrastructures in the health sector. However, current regulations fail to provide clear
guidelines for conducting comprehensive risk assessments (Wilson et al., 2016).

### Limited Collaboration and Information Sharing

Another notable shortcoming is the limited collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders
in the health sector. Cyberattacks on critical infrastructures often exploit interconnected vulnerabilities.

healthcare organizations, regulatory bodies, and relevant stakeholders. However, existing regulations do
not provide sufficient incentives or mechanisms to facilitate such collaboration (Wilson et al., 2016).

### Insufficient Security Standards and Guidelines

The regulatory framework in the health sector lacks clear and enforceable security standards and guidelines. Without these standards, healthcare organizations struggle to implement robust cybersecurity measures. The absence of standardized security practices increases the vulnerability of critical infrastructures,
making them attractive targets for cybercriminals (Wilson et al., 2016).

### Inadequate Incident Response and Recovery Mechanisms

The current regulatory framework also exhibits shortcomings in terms of incident response and recovery
mechanisms. Effective incident response is crucial in minimizing the impact of cyberattacks and restoring
critical infrastructures promptly. However, the existing regulations lack specific provisions for incident
response and recovery, leaving the health sector ill-prepared to handle cyber threats (Wilson et al., 2016).

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing research provides valuable insights into the shortcomings of the regulatory framework
for protecting critical infrastructures in the health sector, there are still significant knowledge gaps that
need to be addressed. These knowledge gaps present opportunities for future research to enhance the
regulatory framework and strengthen cybersecurity measures.

### Comprehensive Risk Assessment Methodologies

Future research should focus on developing comprehensive risk assessment methodologies tailored to the
health sector. This research should explore the specific vulnerabilities and threats faced by critical infrastructures in healthcare and provide guidelines for conducting effective risk assessments. Additionally,
studies should investigate the integration of risk assessment frameworks into the regulatory framework to
ensure proactive cybersecurity measures (Wilson et al., 2016).

### Collaboration and Information Sharing Mechanisms

To address the limited collaboration and information sharing in the health sector, future research should
explore effective mechanisms and incentives to encourage stakeholders' collaboration. This research
should examine the potential benefits of sharing threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned
among healthcare organizations, regulatory bodies, and other relevant stakeholders. By fostering collaboration, the regulatory framework can improve cybersecurity preparedness and response (Wilson et al.,
2016).

### Development of Security Standards and Guidelines

Further research is needed to develop clear and enforceable security standards and guidelines specifically
tailored to the health sector. This research should consider the unique requirements and challenges of
healthcare organizations and provide practical recommendations to enhance cybersecurity measures. By
establishing standardized security practices, critical infrastructures in the health sector can better defend
against cyber threats (Wilson et al., 2016).

### Incident Response and Recovery Mechanisms

Future research should focus on developing incident response and recovery mechanisms that align with
the regulatory framework in the health sector. This research should explore the integration of incident
response plans, incident reporting mechanisms, and coordination among stakeholders. By strengthening
incident response capabilities, the health sector can mitigate the impact of cyberattacks and ensure the
timely recovery of critical infrastructures (Wilson et al., 2016).

## Conclusion

The regulatory framework for the protection of critical infrastructures against cyberthreats, particularly
in the health sector, exhibits several shortcomings. These include the lack of comprehensive risk assessment, limited collaboration and information sharing, insufficient security standards and guidelines, and
inadequate incident response and recovery mechanisms. Future research should address these knowledge
gaps by developing comprehensive risk assessment methodologies, exploring collaboration mechanisms, establishing security standards, and enhancing incident response capabilities. By addressing these
shortcomings and conducting further research, the regulatory framework can effectively protect critical
infrastructures in the health sector against cyber threats.
