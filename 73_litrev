# Literature Review: Sustainable Supply Chain Management Trends in World Regions

## Introduction

Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has gained significant attention in recent years as organizations strive to minimize their environmental impact and promote responsible resource management.
This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the trends and challenges in SSCM
across different world regions. By integrating and synthesizing research findings, this review will highlight
the current state of SSCM, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest potential future research directions.

## Industrial Transformation Challenges and Opportunities in Ethiopia

One of the key challenges in achieving sustainable supply chain management is the transformation of
industrial zones. According to a study by [Author et al. (Year)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f48f7692ad1ed106e363673d68c5d573a95637d), industrial zones in Ethiopia face various challenges and opportunities for industrial transformation. The study emphasizes the need for sustainable
practices within these zones to mitigate environmental impacts and promote resource conservation.
Further research could explore the specific strategies and policies that can facilitate sustainable industrial
transformation in Ethiopia.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis of Green Infrastructure for Water Management in Peru

Water management is a crucial aspect of sustainable supply chain management, and the use of green
infrastructure projects has gained attention as a viable solution. A cost-benefit analysis conducted by
[Devincentis et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.50.8.1196) evaluated the implementation
of a green infrastructure project for water management in Peru. The study found that the project
provided significant environmental and economic benefits, highlighting the potential of such initiatives
in promoting sustainable water resource management. Future research could focus on the scalability and
replicability of green infrastructure projects in different regions and industries.

## Water Allocation Planning and Technology Innovation in South Africa

Effective allocation of freshwater resources is crucial for sustainable water management. In South Africa,
water allocation planning requires the integration of hydrological modeling and innovative technologies.
According to [Amoo (2018)](https://doi.org/10.51415/10321/3251), sustainable water allocation planning in the Mkomazi Basin of South Africa necessitates hydrological modeling and the adoption of
water technology innovation. This research highlights the importance of technological advancements and
behavioral changes in promoting sustainable water management practices. Future research could explore

the socio-economic factors influencing the adoption of water technology innovations in different regions
and the role of behavioral change in achieving sustainable water allocation.

## Conclusion

This literature review has provided a comprehensive analysis of sustainable supply chain management
trends across different world regions. Through the integration and synthesis of research findings, it is
evident that industrial transformation, green infrastructure projects for water management, and water
allocation planning are key areas of focus in promoting sustainability. However, there are knowledge gaps
that warrant further research, such as the specific strategies for sustainable industrial transformation in
Ethiopia, the scalability of green infrastructure projects, and the socio-economic factors influencing the
adoption of water technology innovations. Addressing these gaps will contribute to the advancement of
sustainable supply chain management practices globally.
