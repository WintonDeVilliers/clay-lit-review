# Literature Review: Exploring the Concept of Public-Private Partnership in Building Critical Infrastructure Resilience against Unexpected Events: A Systematic Review

The concept of public-private partnership (PPP) in building critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) has
gained significant attention in recent years. This literature review aims to explore the attributes and
objectives of key stakeholders, namely the government and private critical infrastructure operators, in
PPP for CIR. While there have been several studies on critical infrastructure resilience, the concept of
PPP in CIR has not received much attention. Therefore, this review seeks to fill this knowledge gap by
integrating and synthesizing the provided research findings.
One of the critical factors for the success of PPP in infrastructure delivery is the identification and
management of critical success factors (CSFs) (Babatunde et al., 2012). CSFs are specific factors that
significantly impact the outcome of PPP projects. These factors can include effective risk allocation, clear
communication channels, robust governance structures, and the establishment of trust between the public
and private sectors (Babatunde et al., 2012; Sharma, 2012). By understanding and addressing these CSFs,
stakeholders can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of PPP projects, leading to improved critical
infrastructure resilience.
Another important aspect of PPP in infrastructure projects is the consideration of life cycle critical success
factors (LCSFs) (Liu et al., 2015). LCSFs are factors that influence the performance and success of PPP
projects throughout their life cycle, including the planning, procurement, implementation, and operation
stages. Liu et al. (2015) identified several LCSFs, such as effective risk management, clear project
objectives, stakeholder collaboration, and proper contract management. By considering these LCSFs,
stakeholders can ensure the long-term resilience of critical infrastructure against unexpected events.
Determining the key determinants of PPP in infrastructure projects is also crucial for understanding and
improving the concept of PPP in CIR. Sharma (2012) identified several determinants of PPP in developing
economies, including legal and regulatory frameworks, political stability, financial viability, and public
awareness. Understanding these determinants can help policymakers and practitioners create an enabling
environment for successful PPP implementation, thereby enhancing critical infrastructure resilience.
In addition to the factors and determinants mentioned above, the integration of precise point positioning
(PPP) technology can also contribute to the resilience of critical infrastructure systems. Geng and Shi
(2017) proposed a rapid initialization method for real-time PPP by resolving undifferenced GPS and

GLONASS ambiguities simultaneously. This technique can improve the accuracy and reliability of
positioning information, which is essential for critical infrastructure systems. Similarly, Li et al. (2021)
presented a semi-tightly coupled integration of multi-GNSS PPP and S-VINS for precise positioning
in GNSS-challenged environments. This integration can enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure
systems in challenging conditions, such as areas with poor GNSS signal availability.
Resilience index construction is another important aspect of critical infrastructure protection. Fisher et al.
(2010) developed a resilience index for the Enhanced Critical Infrastructure Protection Program. This
index includes various indicators and metrics that assess the resilience of critical infrastructure systems.
By using such an index, stakeholders can monitor and evaluate the resilience of critical infrastructure
systems, identify vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate strategies to enhance resilience.
To ensure the post-disaster resilience of critical infrastructure systems, Croope and McNeil (2011)
proposed several strategies, including strengthening interagency coordination, improving communication
and information sharing, enhancing redundancy and backup systems, and investing in infrastructure
resilience. These strategies can help critical infrastructure systems withstand unexpected events and
recover quickly in the aftermath of disasters.
Furthermore, the allocation of risks in PPP water-infrastructure projects in developing countries is a
critical factor for their success. Ameyaw and Chan (2016) proposed a fuzzy approach for risk allocation
in PPP projects, which allows for a more flexible and comprehensive assessment of risks. By employing
such an approach, stakeholders can allocate risks effectively, reducing the likelihood of disruptions to
critical infrastructure systems.
Lastly, the evaluation and analysis of operational management critical success factors (OMCSFs) can
contribute to the success of PPP infrastructure projects. Osei-Kyei et al. (2017) conducted a fuzzy
synthetic evaluation analysis of OMCSFs and identified several key factors, such as effective project
management, stakeholder involvement, and the use of appropriate technology. By considering these OMCSFs, stakeholders can ensure the smooth operation and management of critical infrastructure systems,
enhancing their overall resilience.
In conclusion, this literature review has explored the concept of public-private partnership (PPP) in building critical infrastructure resilience (CIR). By integrating and synthesizing the provided research findings,
it has been established that identifying and managing critical success factors (CSFs) and life cycle critical
success factors (LCSFs), understanding determinants of PPP, integrating precise point positioning (PPP)
technology, constructing resilience indices, implementing post-disaster resilience strategies, allocating
risks effectively, and considering operational management critical success factors (OMCSFs) are crucial

for enhancing critical infrastructure resilience. However, further research is needed to explore the specific
methodologies and strategies for effectively implementing PPP in CIR and to address the challenges and
limitations associated with this approach. Future studies should also investigate the interrelationships
among different critical success factors and their impact on the resilience of critical infrastructure systems.
