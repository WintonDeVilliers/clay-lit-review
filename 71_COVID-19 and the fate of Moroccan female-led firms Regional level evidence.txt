Abstract
This study examines the effects of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Moroccan female-led firms,
considering both short-term and long-term impacts. It
investigates the influence of different pandemic waves on
these firms, taking into account their size and location, to
gain valuable insights into their crisis management strategies. Using a micro-level database made up of 1,096 Moroccan firms observed during the initial three waves of the
pandemic, we extract data from the World Bank ‘Enterprise
Survey: impact on firms’ database. Our analysis, using a
logit model, reveals that the impact of the pandemic varied
by the gender of the firm head and survey period. Femaleled firms were more severely affected by the health crisis
compared with their male peers. The quick application of
policy adaptations played a crucial role in reducing the
impact of the health crisis on male-led enterprises. Small
firms, particularly those situated in regions such as Beni
Mellal-Khenifra, Drâa-Tafilalet, Oriental, and MarrakechSafi, have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. This study makes two key contributions. Firstly, it provides an empirical analysis of the pandemic's impact on
Moroccan firms using enterprise-level data, which is
unprecedented in Morocco. Secondly, it investigates the
repercussions of the pandemic on female-led Moroccan
firms of varying sizes and regions, acknowledging the disproportionate impact on women during economic crises.
The study aims to offer valuable insights for supporting the

recovery of female-led firms in the future. Our findings
emphasize the importance of targeted assistance for small
firms and those located in affected regions to mitigate the
crisis's consequences and promote economic revival. These
businesses play a crucial role in the local economy, and
supporting their survival and resilience in the post-COVID19 era is essential.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, also known as the coronavirus epidemic, has had a profound
impact on the global economy since its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It rapidly spread across the
globe, resulting in widespread disruptions. As of May 31, 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported
a total of 767,364,883 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 6,938,353 deaths. In a connected world, the global implementation of lockdowns and travel restrictions has significantly slowed down economic activity and disrupted production processes. This global turbulence has led to a decline in world stock market indexes and has affected
businesses of all sizes. Consequently, the world experienced a severe recession in 2020, with a contraction of 3.1%
in economic growth. Inflation remains persistently high, and commercial activities have slowed down considerably.
Even the slight recovery observed in 2021 was hindered by the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and supply chain disruptions during the latter months of the year. According to projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF,
2022), the global impact of the coronavirus crisis will have a long-lasting effect. Both employment and production
levels are expected to remain below their pre-pandemic levels until 2026. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has left
a lasting mark on the global economy, with far-reaching consequences that continue to impact various sectors and
nations worldwide.
The impact of the coronavirus has extended far beyond being just a disease, intensifying the health issues confronting nations globally (Hafeez et al., 2023) and resulting in the loss of millions of lives in our interconnected world.
Beyond the health consequences (Iorember et al., 2022), COVID-19 caused public panic and shed light on the shortcomings in both healthcare systems and economies worldwide (Abbas & Al-Sulaiti, 2023). On the healthcare front,
many systems were unprepared to handle the scale and speed of a pandemic outbreak, revealing issues such as limited infrastructure, inadequate healthcare facilities, and shortages of essential medical supplies and equipment.
Moreover, the sudden surge in patients overwhelmed healthcare workers, highlighting the need for a properly sized
and trained workforce. Accessibility to healthcare services also became a concern, as existing disparities were amplified, with marginalized communities facing greater challenges in accessing quality care. Fragile global health systems
and the interconnectedness of the world amplified the impact of the pandemic. Healthcare systems in developing
countries struggled with limited resources, exacerbating the global health crisis. It underscored the need for a robust
global system for pandemic preparedness. In light of these issues, the study of Micah et al. (2023) revealed significant
disparities in global health spending, with high-income countries investing significantly more than low-income countries. In 2019, high-income countries spent $7.3 trillion on health, while low-income countries spent only $24.8 billion. Nevertheless, considering the historical underfunding of pandemic preparedness, deliberate efforts must be
ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1741
made to sustain funding for crucial global health functions, including pandemic preparedness. Simultaneously, pandemics brought to light various economic shortcomings. Global supply chains experienced disruptions, impacting
industries and economies globally (Naeem et al., 2021). The interdependence of countries became apparent as production and distribution networks faltered. Business closures and job losses became widespread due to lockdown
measures and economic downturns, leading to rising unemployment rates and financial hardships. Furthermore, existing economic inequalities were exacerbated, with vulnerable populations, such as low-income earners and informal
workers, bearing the brunt of the crisis and facing greater financial instability. As a result, the global economy has
faced a crisis that affected national economies and highlighted social inequalities in many countries (Baldwin
et al., 2020). The severity of the crisis differs significantly between developed and developing countries (Egger
et al., 2021). For instance, implementing social distancing and containment policies imposed by governments were
hard to apply in developing countries, where a large portion of the population is forced to work to survive severe
poverty or hunger (Bargain & Aminjonov, 2020). Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented
levels of fiscal and monetary stimuli to mitigate the economic damage caused by the pandemic. These measures have
included direct cash transfers to individuals and businesses, loan guarantees, interest rate cuts, and quantitative easing programs. While these interventions have provided short-term support to the global economy, concerns have
arisen regarding the potential longer-term consequences of such extensive fiscal and monetary support. In particular,
there are worries about inflation, debt sustainability, and the potential for financial instability in the future.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused sudden and drastic changes in people's daily lives (Whitaker et al., 2021),
resulting in major disruptions to various aspects of society. This includes shifts in how people work, socialize, and shop,
as well as changes in the operations of companies and industries. Lockdowns, social distancing measures, and other
containment efforts have forced people to adapt to new ways of living and working, often with minimal notice or preparation. These changes have occurred rapidly and unexpectedly, unlike the changes that would typically happen in normal circumstances. As a result, there have been significant changes in consumer behavior, such as a surge in online
shopping due to people's inability or unwillingness to visit physical stores (Al Halbusi et al., 2022). Companies have had
to quickly adapt to these changes, often by implementing new technologies and strategies to support remote work and
e-commerce. This has led to significant disruptions in many industries, as well as opportunities for new business models
and innovation (Abbas et al., 2019). During the COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence and technology have played
a crucial role in various aspects (Shah, Zhang, Abbas, et al., 2023). They have been instrumental in tracking and monitoring the spread of the virus, facilitating the development of vaccines, enabling remote work and education (Kovalska &
Kovalova, 2021), and promoting sustainable practices such as remote meetings and digital solutions that reduce physical contact. This situation highlights the potential positive effects on the environment that can result from reduced
human activities and increased reliance on technology. Specifically, the pandemic has revealed the positive contribution
of information and communication technology (ICT) to reducing CO2 emissions (Lorente et al., 2023; Shah, Zhang,
Abbas, et al., 2023). The implementation of lockdowns and travel restrictions led to a significant decrease in transportation and industrial activities, resulting in temporary improvements in air quality and reduced carbon emissions. These
outcomes underscore the potential for technology to contribute to environmental sustainability during times of crisis.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented societal changes, with major implications for individuals,
businesses, and industries. The full extent of these changes is still unfolding, and it is likely that the long-term impacts
of the pandemic will continue to be felt for many years to come.
Within the vast tapestry of global ramifications, Morocco is no exception and stands as a testament to the farreaching effects of pandemic. The nation has experienced a seismic disruption in production, as supply chains faltered and businesses grappled with operational challenges. Moreover, healthcare costs increased as the country
mobilized resources to combat the virus and ensure the well-being of its citizens. In this challenging environment,
efforts have been made to extend financial support to vulnerable social groups and provide relief to firms striving to
weather the crisis. Pandemic impacts are reflected in all 12 regions of Morocco, but in each of them differently, considering the diversity of socioeconomic profiles, the leading sectors, and the patterns of virus spreading in the
regions. The sectors most exposed to economic losses were tourism (hotels and restaurants), metallurgical industry,
1742 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
textiles and leather, and public works (Ait Ali, Bassou, et al., 2020; Haddad et al., 2020). In their study, Ait Ali, El
Aynaoui, et al. (2020) anticipated that the social impact of the crisis will push about 1 million people in Morocco into
poverty and about 900,000 others under the poverty line. Unfortunately, Moroccan women are among the most vulnerable to the social and economic consequences of this crisis. The confinement measures due to the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in additional domestic work for women. In Morocco, women already carry out the majority of
unpaid domestic tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children and elderly family members. The burden
of this work falls disproportionately on women, as indicated by a study that found that 92% of women are involved
in housework compared with 24% of men (High Commission for Planning [HCP, 2022]). The pandemic exacerbated
this gender gap by further limiting women's participation in other spheres such as education and employment
(Whitaker et al., 2021). With the closure of schools, women who are also responsible for their children's education
may have to devote even more time to domestic work, reducing their opportunities to engage in paid work or pursue
education or training. Moreover, the isolation at home resulting from the pandemic caused violence against them to
increase (Ennaji, 2021). With restrictions on movement and social interaction, women who are victims of domestic
violence may find it more difficult to seek help and escape from their abusers. With their low participation in the
labor force, which stands at only 21.3% and is primarily concentrated in the agricultural and industrial sectors
(OECD, 2020), they are disproportionately affected by job loss and reduced economic activity in these sectors.
According to a study conducted by the national statistics agency, HCP, in 2021, the percentage of women in the
workforce in Morocco was only 23%, which is a decrease from the 27% reported in 2010. This is in stark contrast to
the fact that women make up 50.2% of the country's population. Furthermore, approximately 17% (OECD, 2020) of
women employed outside of agriculture work informally or as unpaid family worker (Mansuy & Werquin, 2018),
meaning they lack formal contracts or social protections such as sick leave or health insurance. As a result, they are
particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of confinement measures and the economic slowdown resulting from
the pandemic. With the closure of businesses and restrictions on movement, these women are at risk of losing their
livelihoods and may struggle to provide for themselves and their families. Even in leadership positions, women
remain underrepresented in top management positions in many countries, including Morocco, where in 2019, only
13% of Moroccan companies were headed by women, with the highest representation in services at 19%, followed
by trade at 14% and industry at 13% (Mouline et al., 2022). While studies such as the one carried out by Zhang et al.
(2022) have shown that the presence of female directors can reduce tax avoidance behavior in prospector companies, this study aims to explore the relationship between different business strategies and corporate tax avoidance
decisions, while also examining the moderating effect of gender diversity. The study utilizes a sample of non-financial
sector organizations in Pakistan over a span of 5 years. The issue of corporate tax avoidance has become increasingly
relevant in developing economies, where taxation plays a critical role in government revenues and public services,
which underlines the importance of promoting greater gender diversity in management positions.
It is unfortunate that there have not been studies conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on
female-led firms in Morocco. It is difficult to provide an accurate portrayal of the current economic situation for
women entrepreneurs in Morocco (Bouzekraoui, 2022). However, even without a formal study, it is still possible to
gain some insights into the current situation of women entrepreneurs by looking at general trends and observations
related to the pandemic's impact on businesses and the economy as a whole. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses across the globe, with many facing closures, reduced revenue, and
financial uncertainty (Kaberia & Muathe, 2020). Female entrepreneurs in particular may be more vulnerable, as their
firms are younger and smaller (Manolova et al., 2020), especially to the effects of the pandemic due to factors such
as limited access to financing, limited networks, and societal norms that may limit their opportunities. During the
health crisis, Morocco's economic recovery depended on the speed of national vaccination campaigns and the progression of the epidemic (Ait Ali, Bassou, et al., 2020). In this particular context, firms were exposed to a high level of
incertitude as to the future (Apedo-Amah et al., 2020) and adopted a ‘wait and see’ approach (Ait Ali, El Aynaoui,
et al., 2020) before investing. On the basis of the results of the HCP's (High Commission for Planning of Morocco)
survey on the effects of COVID-19 on firms’ activities in April 2020, more than 57% of Moroccan firms have stopped
ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1743
their activities permanently or temporarily as a result of the coronavirus crisis. By category of firms, very small firms
(VSFs) represent 72%, small and medium firms (SMFs) 26%, and large firms (LFs) 2% of all firms that are temporarily or
permanently closed. However, the national economic structure was composed of 93% of very small and medium firms
(HCP, national survey of firms 2019) that contribute to the development and creation of the nation's wealth. The
Casablanca-Settat region predominates as the location of those firms (39%). Morocco adopted several actions to
reduce the impact on the national economy and on vulnerable social segments of the society. The kingdom was one of
the first countries to increase health infrastructure provision (Morocco's strategy facing COVID-19, April 2020). The
country adopted an extensive COVID-19 vaccination program, and even planned to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines.
On the social level, the country has taken actions to reduce the impact of the crisis through social support in the face
of a serious situation of job losses, increasing unemployment, and income decline. On the economic level, the government started the ‘Special Fund for managing the coronavirus pandemic’ with subventions to the most damaged firms
and households, emphasizing the significance of reforms that are crucial for enhancing economic opportunities, boosting income and employment rates, and providing comprehensive social benefits (Hussain et al., 2021).
The literature shows that the COVID-19 health crisis had a significant impact on the Moroccan economy. It is
possible that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on female-led firms in Morocco, but without a specific
study on this topic, it is difficult to say for certain. This study intends to examine the impact of the COVID-19 health
crisis on female-led firms. To conduct our research, we utilized a dataset that focused on the microeconomics of
Moroccan firms during the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset was composed of 1,096
Moroccan firms and was sourced from the ‘Enterprise Survey: impact on firms’ database, which is maintained by the
World Bank. To analyze this data and estimate the likelihood of specific outcomes occurring, we employed a statistical model known as the logit model. Through the use of this model, we were able to derive estimates that helped us
better understand the impact of the pandemic on these firms. This paper will contribute to existing literature in two
ways. First, we mobilize microeconomic data on indicators quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on
firms as well as on the internal characteristics of 1,096 Moroccan firms. Second, our study aims to analyze the impact
of the COVID-19 health crisis on female-led firms by size and region. The next sections include a literature review
(Section 2): in this section, we reviewed and synthesized existing scholarly literature relevant to our research topic.
Its aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge, identify gaps or controversies
in the literature, and establish the theoretical framework for our study. Stylized facts (Section 3): in this section, we
present and discuss the key stylized facts related to our research. Empirical methodology (Section 4): this
section describes the research design and methodology used to collect and analyze data in the study. It outlines the
research approach, data sources, sample selection, variables, and the econometric techniques employed. The purpose
is to provide a clear and transparent explanation of how our study was conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. Reporting and discussion of results (Section 5): in this section, we present our findings on the basis
of the data analysis. It includes a detailed report of the results, supported by tables. We then interpret and discuss
those findings in relation to the research question and the existing literature. Concluding notes (Section 6): this final
section of our paper summarizes our main findings and their implications. It highlights the contributions of the study,
discusses any limitations, and suggests avenues for future research. This section reiterates the significance of this
research and offers recommendations and policy implications based on our results.
2 | LITERATURE REVIEW
It is evident that the effects of the pandemic were felt by everyone (Goldin, 2022), but some categories of agents
(individuals, firms, and sectors) suffered the effects of the coronavirus crisis more than others. The profound consequences of global health crises, such as COVID-19, have had a particularly severe impact on vulnerable groups, especially rural households, in which the lockdown had a direct impact on their employment status and income (Ghanbari
Movahed et al., 2022; Suresh et al., 2022). Women in particular bore a significant burden of the economic impact
1744 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
and personal hardships (Goldin, 2022), and elderly women were more prone to encountering significant health difficulties. Among these difficulties are intricate care requirements, mental health disorders, and a heightened susceptibility to domestic violence (Su et al., 2022). Unfortunately, lockdown measures implemented to curb the spread of
the virus further exacerbated these challenges by disrupting or discontinuing essential health services that elderly
women rely on. A multitude of research studies have delved into the consequences of pandemics and disasters on
different sectors. In their study, Kumar et al. (2021) examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors of the Indian economy. The authors mobilized existing data on those sectors and on both the pandemic and
propagation of COVID-19. Their review revealed that the finance, health, education, industry, energy, petroleum,
and environment sectors were among the most severely affected. While the study provides a useful overview of the
pandemic's impact on these sectors, it has limitations in that it only considers a select number of sectors, omitting
others such as tourism and hospitality, which may also have been severely impacted. Notably, the service industry
has emerged as highly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of such crises (Abbas & Al-Sulaiti, 2023; Lu et al., 2021).
Particularly the tourism, travel, leisure industry, and hospitality sectors have been hit the hardest, with over 50% revenue losses (Abbas, Mubeen, et al., 2021). Travel restrictions led to a substantial decrease of 74% in tourist numbers
across the continent, as estimated by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO, 2021). Tourism,
specifically cultural tourism, holds immense importance as it contributes to various aspects such as social value creation, environmental sustainability, community development, and global cultural understanding (Jawad et al., 2023; Li,
Abbas, et al., 2022; Shah, Zhang, & Abbas, 2023). It serves as a catalyst for economic development, bringing about
positive changes in local communities and fostering a sense of appreciation for diverse cultures (Abbas, Mubeen,
et al., 2021; Mamirkulova et al., 2020). To overcome the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
tourism industry requires innovative strategies and adaptive measures. By gaining a thorough understanding of the
pandemic's impacts and consequences and actively embracing change and innovation, the industry can embark on a
path toward recovery and successfully establish a new normal in the post-pandemic era (Abbas, Mubeen, et al.,
2021). To rebuild and revive the service industry, it is essential to consider changes in the fundamental principles,
main assumptions, and business organizations’ circumstances. In their respective studies, Abbas and Al-Sulaiti (2023)
and Makoza (2023) investigate different aspects of the tourism industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbas and
Al-Sulaiti (2023) explored the effects of innovative transformation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices
in the hospitality sector during the pandemic. They investigated how global health emergencies and economic crises
have affected service firms’ performance worldwide. The authors conclude that innovative business approaches and
CSR activities depend on firms’ innovativeness, environmental contexts, and the nature of CSR that affects productivity. Meanwhile, the study of Makoza (2023) explores the impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on South Africa's
tourism sector and examines the potential of digital nomadism as a recovery strategy. The findings suggest that digital nomadism has the capacity to promote innovation, new work models, and job creation within the tourism industry. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed, such as delays in implementing remote work visas and
uncertainties surrounding digital taxation. These two studies complement each other in providing insights into different aspects of the tourism industry during the pandemic. Abbas and Al-Sulaiti shed light on the importance of innovative and CSR practices for service firms’ performance, while Makoza highlights the potential of digital nomadism
as a strategy for recovery in the tourism sector. Together, these studies contribute to a broader understanding of the
challenges and opportunities faced by the tourism industry and provide valuable insights for industry practitioners
and policymakers.
The problems blocking economic activities around the world (Peterson & Thankom, 2020) were primarily caused
by the speed of the virus’ propagation, which forced many countries to adopt restrictive measures, particularly social
distancing, causing the closure of financial markets, company offices, businesses, shops, and events. Secondly, the
uncertain situation about the crisis created a climate full of panic among consumers, investors, and international trading partners, pushing them into less risky investments and changing consuming behaviors, generating market anomalies (Egger et al., 2021; Mckibbin & Fernando, 2020). Khatib and Nour (2021) discovered that the business landscape
underwent substantial transformations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, various characteristics of
ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1745
business factors such as performance, governance structure, liquidity, and leverage level were significantly impacted.
Firms from all sectors faced a severe drop in both supply and demand with negative consequences on both sales and
employment (Hyland et al., 2021). Apedo-Amah et al. (2020) provide a comprehensive assessment of the short-term
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses worldwide, studying 100,000 firms in 51 countries. The use of a
large sample size, objective measures of impact, and a focus on developing countries are strengths of the study.
There are also some limitations, such as the lack of a comparison group of businesses not affected by the pandemic,
which limits the ability to determine the extent to which the observed effects are due to the pandemic or other factors. Nonetheless, the study's findings provide important insights into the ways in which the pandemic has affected
businesses worldwide. Their results showed that the COVID-19 shock was severe and widespread in all firms, with a
negative impact on sales. The employment adjustments that firms have made in response, the disproportionate
financial constraints faced by smaller firms, and the increasing reliance on digital solutions are all effects of the pandemic. Employment adaptation was based primarily on holidays and reducing working hours, with limited lay-off of
small firms facing higher financial barriers, although access to finance remains one of the principal determinants of
the viability of any firm category (Elouaourti & Ezzahid, 2022b; Ezzahid & Elouaourti, 2018). Amin and Viganola
(2021) appear to have found a significant relationship between access to finance and the likelihood of a decline in
sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used a logit model with binary choice and data from the World
Bank's Enterprise Survey database, which included 9,432 firms. One potential strength of the study is its use of a
large dataset, which improves the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study appears to have considered
heterogeneity in the relationship between access to finance and sales decline on the basis of factors such as a firm's
long-standing relationships with stakeholders and the gender composition of its workforce. However, it is important
to note that the study is limited by its focus on self-reported data from firms. Despite the fact that the COVID-19
pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for businesses worldwide, including those in China, firms have
struggled to adapt to changing market conditions, and questions have arisen about the role of product market competition in driving firm performance (Li, Al-Sulaiti, et al., 2022). Liu, Qu, et al. (2021) were able to come out with a
positive impact of the competition on the firms in times of crisis by investigating the impact of product market competition on the performance of Chinese business organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the
annual reports of firms listed on the A-share stock market and registered with the China Stock Markets and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database, the study employs the generalized method of moments technique to analyze the
relationship between competition and firm performance in China. The results reveal a positive and significant impact
of product market competition on firm performance, indicating the importance of competition in promoting healthier
business performance in the Chinese market. These findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on the role of competition in driving economic growth and development, particularly in times of crisis. However, it is important to note
that this study is focused on the Chinese market and may not be generalizable to other markets or contexts.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health, and its effects on the economy have been
equally significant. In addition to government restrictions, a drop of demand and a shortage of raw materials and
essential inputs left firms facing a series of challenges and with limited alternatives, such as reducing their activities
or closing their businesses (Ahmed et al., 2020). Small businesses have been particularly hard hit, with many
experiencing mass layoffs and closures. To gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses and to
assess the likely impact of the recent stimulus bill, a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses was conducted by
Bartik et al. (2020). The survey found that a large number of small businesses had already experienced mass layoffs
and closures, with 43% of businesses temporarily closed and a 40% reduction in employee counts on average. The
study also revealed that many small businesses are financially fragile, with the median business having more than
$10,000 in monthly expenses and less than 1 month of cash on hand. Furthermore, the study found that businesses
have varying beliefs about the duration of COVID-related disruptions, and the majority of businesses planned to
seek funding through the CARES Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the aid due to bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility. With the disruptions in economies and societies around the
world, businesses have had to adapt rapidly to changing circumstances and implement new strategies to sustain their
1746 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
operations in response to the pandemic. Governments have also had to play a crucial role in providing support and
resources to businesses to help them navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic. The study conducted by Fakhoury and Fakih (2021) provides valuable insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in
Jordan and Morocco and the role of governments and businesses in responding to pandemics in the Arab region.
The study uses the COVID-19 World Bank Enterprise Survey, and found that businesses that adopted resilient strategies such as establishing an online presence and converting production are more likely to remain open, while firms
that adopted remote working are less likely to survive. However, it is important to note that the study does not
establish causality, and the results may not be generalizable to other countries or regions. The study also found a
mismatch between government support measures and the needs of businesses during a pandemic, with firms that
expected future government support more likely to report closure. Furthermore, a more recent study investigates
the relationship between remote work policies and firm performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, using data
from the COVID-19 World Bank Enterprise Survey in Jordan and Morocco. By using the propensity score matching
technique, Boutros et al. (2023) estimate the causal effect of remote work on productivity. The study's findings indicate that remote work policies have a positive impact on firm performance, leading to increased productivity. However, it is important to note that the analysis is restricted to two countries, and the statistical significance of the
results is observed only in Morocco. Additionally, the study explores the effects of remote work policies on firms of
different sizes. The results show positive and statistically significant coefficients across all models, suggesting that
remote work policies have a beneficial effect on firm performance regardless of the company's size.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects on businesses worldwide, with many struggling to adapt
to new restrictions and market conditions. However, the impacts of the pandemic have not been gender neutral.
Women-led businesses in particular have faced disproportionate challenges during the pandemic. In a recent study
by Liu, Wei, and Xu (2021), the authors investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and how
gender affects the probability and duration of business closure. The study, which analyzed data from 24 countries,
revealed that female-led businesses experienced more significant challenges during the pandemic than male-led businesses. In particular, the research found that women-led businesses were more likely to close and experienced longer
closure periods compared with those led by men. Moreover, female business leaders demonstrated more pessimism
about the future than their male counterparts. The study also indicated that women-led businesses in economies of
high gender inequality and developing economies faced more significant disparities. The authors suggested that
finance and labor-related factors contributed to these inequalities. In light of these findings, the study recommends
that COVID-19 policy responses should take into account gender disparities to address the disproportionate impact
of the pandemic on women-led businesses. In another study that highlighted the disparities between men and
women in terms of corporate performance in times of crisis, Hyland et al. (2021) used firm data from 41 countries
during 2020–2021 to examine whether gender influences firm performance during the COVID-19 health crisis. They
found that female-led firms were more likely to have closed temporarily during the crisis and to have been closed for
a longer period. Even those firms that were able to maintain their activities endured a demand decline in their products or services, downsizing, reduced working hours, and more financial difficulties compared with male-led firms.
While the study provides important insights into the differential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on male and femaleled firms, it is important to note that the study did not investigate the underlying reasons for the observed differences in performance between them. Moreover, the study did not explore whether the observed differences in performance between male and female-led firms are unique to the COVID-19 crisis or whether they exist during more
normal times as well. These findings are not specific to the coronavirus crisis: in fact, even during the 2008 crisis,
female entrepreneurs had a similar experience. The study conducted by Ahmed et al. (2020) provides valuable
insights into the differential effects of the 2008 financial crisis on male- and female-led firms in six European and
Asian countries. The study is based on firm-level data, which is a robust and reliable source of information, and from
multiple countries, which increases the generalizability of the findings. Their results showed that the exit rate for
female-led firms was higher than for male-led firms, indicating that female-led firms were more vulnerable to the crisis. The study also finds that in the long term, the impact of the crisis was stronger for female-led firms. However,
ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1747
the study is based on data collected immediately after the crisis, which means that the long-term effects of the crisis
on female-led firms may be underestimated.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global economies, leading to job losses, reduced
income, and increased poverty rates. In response, policymakers and researchers are exploring ways to promote economic growth (Ezzahid & Elouaourti, 2021a, 2021b) and support vulnerable populations. Inequality in the labor market is a persistent issue that has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 health crisis. To understand the impact
of the crisis on various segments of the labor market in Turkey, Aldan et al. (2021) conducted a study utilizing quarterly labor force data from 2005 to 2020. The empirical results revealed that the crisis reduced labor market participation for all population groups in Turkey, but the impact was heterogeneous in size. However, this impact was
more important on women, older people, and people with low levels of education. Similar results were found in
Suleiman's (2021) analysis on the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on female employment in North African countries
(Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia). The results from the descriptive analysis show that female labor force participation
has declined since the outbreak of the COVID-19 health crisis, particularly in Egypt and Morocco. Ultimately,
increasing female participation in the labor market remains a challenge for governments in the North African region
(Ibourk & Elouaourti, 2023). The findings of both studies demonstrate the unequal impact of the COVID-19 health
crisis on different segments of the labor market, with vulnerable groups such as women, older individuals, and those
with lower levels of education being hit harder. One potential solution is to promote entrepreneurship, particularly
among women who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The study of Ge et al. (2022) aimed to
examine the role of women's entrepreneurship and innovative use of technology in contributing to household
income during the pandemic. The study found that women entrepreneurs are adept at innovating, taking risks, and
combining various factors to cope with the uncertain business environment. To gather data, the study used a selfadministered questionnaire in selected rural and urban areas of Faisalabad district, and an ordered logit model was
used to estimate the effects of various factors such as age, education, family size, income from other sources, time
allocated to entrepreneurial activity, firm size, and location on the contribution of entrepreneurial income to household income. The results showed that education, family size, time allocated to entrepreneurial activities, and firm size
had a positive and significant impact on the contribution of entrepreneurial income to household income. Moreover,
the study found that the contribution of entrepreneurial income to household income was significantly higher in rural
areas compared with urban areas. The study concludes that creating an environment that encourages gender equality and entrepreneurial culture among women can help increase family income and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5 and 8, which relate to gender equality and decent work and economic growth. Overall, this
study provides valuable insights into the importance of women's entrepreneurship in promoting economic growth
and reducing gender inequality.
3 | STYLIZED FACTS: FEMALE-LED FIRMS IMPACTED THE MOST
Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on 12 Moroccan regions showed that the region with the highest number of
COVID-19 cases is also the most affected in terms of lost economic growth (Figure 1). This correlation is likely due
to measures taken to curb the spread of the virus, such as closures and restrictions on business activities. These measures resulted in firm closures and job losses, leading to a decline in economic activity.
A graphical analysis of the principal indicators from the Enterprise Survey: impact on firms (Morocco) database,
covering the year 2020 and three waves of coronavirus propagation, showed that the impact of the COVID-19
health crisis was heterogeneous between the gender of the firm's leader as well as between the survey period. At
the time of the first survey round (after the first wave of COVID-19 occurred after March 2020), the impact of the
COVID-19 crisis as well as the adjustment measures applied by firms were identical between those directed by men
and those directed by women. From Figure 2 we can conclude that at the time of the first survey: impact on firms,
the two categories of firms were at similar levels in the percentage of permanent closures since the COVID-19
1748 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
pandemic was officially announced, the percentage of temporary closures during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the
percentage of beneficiaries of government or local support. However, for other indicators, the two categories of
firms differed in the proportion of the workforce working remotely, the percentage of firms that have adapted or
changed their production or services, and the percentage of firms that have started or increased their online commercial activity. Male-led firms outperformed female-led firms in the first round of the survey. This shows a speed of
adaptation to the changes caused by the COVID-19 health crisis by male-led firms.

ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1749
The dynamic analysis of the same indicators in the second round of the survey shows that for indicators related to
the situation/performance of firms during the COVID-19 health crisis (percentage of firms that closed definitely or temporarily), female-led firms were more affected in the second wave of the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 3). This may be
explained by the fast adaptability of male-led firms to the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis observed in the first
round of the survey, allowing them to reduce the impact of the health crisis on their activities and their firms. Analysis
of the same ‘adaptation’ indicators (online sales, home delivery and remote working, etc.) in the second round of the
survey shows that women-led firms have made significant progress compared with men-led firms. However, in terms
of indicators referring to the change of business activity and online sales, male-led firms remain in the lead. After the
second wave of COVID-19, which began in July 2021, the proportion of the workforce working remotely and the percentage of firms that had started home delivery were at the same level for both categories of firms.
After the second wave of COVID-19, a graphical analysis of the performance indicators and adaptation policies
implemented at the enterprise level shows that, at the time of the third survey round (after the third wave from
December 2021 onward), the percentage of enterprises that have definitely or temporarily closed due to the
COVID-19 health crisis was higher among enterprises headed by women compared with those headed by men. The
gap in adaptability to the change provoked by this crisis persists at the time of the third round of the survey
depending on the gender of the leader of the firm, and for the part of firms that have started remote working and
home delivery, female-led firms are in front of their male-led competitors (Figure 4). Meanwhile, for indicators relating to online sales and the percentage of firms that have adapted or changed their production or services, male-led
firms are in the lead. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to individuals and businesses. In response, numerous studies have emerged to explore various aspects of the pandemic, including its epidemiology, public health response, economic impact, and social implications. The study of Yu et al. (2022) investigated
the relationship between knowledge of COVID-19, social distancing behavior, attitudes toward social media use, and
practices of social media use during the pandemic. The study analyzed data from 348 participants who experienced
direct or indirect effects of COVID-19. The results confirm the proposed hypotheses and demonstrate significant
correlations between COVID-19 knowledge, social distancing, attitudes toward social media use, and practices of
social media use. The study highlights the potential benefits of using social media for businesses, particularly for
small and medium enterprises, to reach new markets and customers. The study suggests that businesses should
invest in online training programs and work-from-home opportunities to give employees flexibility.

1750 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
This preliminary analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the Moroccan entrepreneurial environment reveals that (1) the impact was heterogeneous by gender of firm head and by survey period, (2) female-led
firms were more affected by the COVID-19 health crisis than those led by men, and (3) the fast application of policy
adaptation was one of the determining factors that reduced the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on men-led
enterprises.
4 | EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY: DATA, VARIABLES, AND EMPIRICAL
MODEL
4.1 | Data
We mobilize a micro-level database for 1,096 firms located in all Moroccan regions. It should be noted that the
administrative division in Morocco is composed of 12 regions as defined by Dahir no. 2-15-40 of February 20, 2015.
However, the survey of the firms’ database was limited to only nine regions (Table 1), excluding the three Moroccan
regions of the south, which are the Guelmim-Oued Noun region, the Laayoune-Saguia El Hamra region, and the
Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region. Our study will be extended to all 12 Moroccan regions if the data become available
for the rest of the national regions.
The cross-tabulation of the 1,096 companies in our sample by firm size and by gender of the leader reveals that
only 76 firms are led by women, with a percentage of 7% of our sample, a relatively low proportion that reveals the
low presence of women in leading positions in Moroccan firms of all sizes (Table 2). It is important to note that the
reasons why women lead only 7% of firms in Morocco may be complex and multifaceted, influenced by a variety of
social, cultural, economic, and political factors. Following are some potential arguments that may contribute to this
disparity. Societal norms and expectations: traditional gender roles and societal expectations may discourage women
from pursuing leadership positions in business (Sahraoui, 2016). Women may be expected to prioritize their family
responsibilities over their career, limiting their ability to dedicate time and resources to their businesses. Limited
access to education and resources: women may have limited access to education and resources necessary for
FIGURE 4 The COVID-19 health crisis and Moroccan firms, by gender: round 3. Source: Author creation.
ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA 1751
starting and growing a business. This can include access to capital, networks, mentorship, and training programs.
Gender bias: in terms of economic participation and opportunity, the kingdom placed 148th out of 156 countries on
the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index for the year 2021. Women may face gender bias and discrimination
in the business world, such as being overlooked for leadership roles or being offered lower salaries than their male
counterparts. This can be explained by the glass ceiling hypothesis, a concept defined by the US Department of
Labor in 1991 as ‘artificial barriers based on organizational attitudes or prejudices that prevent qualified individuals
from attaining leadership positions in their organizations’ (Grout et al., 2007). Legal barriers: Morocco may have legal
barriers that limit women's ability to start and grow a business. The question of the legal position of women in
Morocco has been extensively deliberated, with legal provisions that establish gender disparities considered not only
legitimate but also revered due to the intimate connection between Moroccan legislation and the Quran (Hilali
et al., 2020). Lack of support: women may not have the same level of support as men when starting and growing a
business. This can include lack of access to business incubators, accelerators, and other support programs.
4.2 | Study variables
This paper aims to examine the effects of the COVID-19 health crisis on female-led firms, taking into account variations in size and region. Specifically, we seek to explore how the pandemic has influenced the performance and resilience of businesses led by women. In addition, we will test hypotheses related to the differential impacts of the crisis
on female entrepreneurs on the basis of their firm size and geographic location. Due to missing data on the variable

that informs on the definitive closing of firms, we mobilize the variable ‘Did this firm close temporarily due to the
COVID-19 outbreak?’ as the dependent variable, while controlling our model by a set of variables that determine
the performance of the firm including age and whether the firm is a subsidiary, and creating other binary variables by
firm size, sector of activity, and region (Table 3).
The high percentage of firms that temporarily closed during the first wave of the COVID-19 health crisis in
Morocco suggests that this wave had the greatest impact on the country's economic environment. However, the
proportion of firms that temporarily closed decreased significantly in the second wave, to only 14%, and then slightly
increased to 17% in the third wave. This could be due to a variety of factors, including increased preparedness of
firms for the pandemic, better communication and coordination from the government, or simply lower case numbers
in later waves.
Despite the challenges faced by firms during the pandemic, many adopted adjustment policies to try and mitigate the impact on their operations. Information technology has been instrumental in helping firms adapt and navigate through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic (Abbas, Wang, et al., 2021). It enabled remote work,
virtual communication, e-commerce, data analysis, cybersecurity, and digital transformation, allowing businesses to
continue their operations and serve their customers in a rapidly changing landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic
brought about rapid transformations in people's daily lives, prompting unexpected changes in consumer behavior
and fostering previously unprecedented online buying habits. In their study, Al Halbusi et al. (2022) indicate that several factors positively influence customer satisfaction with online purchasing. These factors include hedonic motivation (the pleasure and enjoyment derived from the online shopping experience), habits (repetitive behavior in using
online platforms), perceived risk (the perceived level of risk associated with online shopping), and technological
awareness (knowledge and familiarity with technology). Online commercial activity was the most common policy
adopted by firms in all three waves, with 28% of firms using this approach in the first and third waves, and 41% in the

second wave. This suggests that firms quickly recognized the importance of transitioning to online sales to maintain their
revenue streams. Home delivery was also a popular policy, with 25% of firms using this approach in the first and second
waves, and 14% in the third wave. Telework, on the other hand, was adopted by only 22% of firms in the first wave,
suggesting that this policy may have been less feasible or acceptable in certain sectors or for certain types of work.
4.3 | Empirical model
In the context of our study, where the dependent variable is the binary variable ‘Firms that have closed temporarily’,
the logit model is a suitable technique because it is specifically designed to model binary outcomes. One of the main
advantages of the logit model over other techniques is its ability to estimate the probability of an event occurring. In
this case, the logit model can estimate the probability of a firm closing temporarily on the basis of the independent
variables included in the analysis.
Additionally, the logit model allows for the estimation of the marginal effects of the independent variables on
the dependent variable. These marginal effects can provide insight into the relative importance of each independent
variable in predicting the outcome of interest. Furthermore, the logit model is a widely used technique in empirical
research and is well established in the literature (Elouaourti & Ezzahid, 2022a). The econometric specification of our
model on the 1,096 firm microdata is as follows:
FTCi,j,s,t ¼ α1 þα2ð Þ The top manager is female i,j,s,t þαk
X7
k¼3
Xi,j,s,t þφj þθs þεi,j,t ð1Þ
where FTC corresponds to the firms that have temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 health crisis and is a binary
variable equal to 1 if the firm has closed due to COVID-19 and equal to 0 otherwise. Top manager is a female is a
binary variable equal to 1 if the gender of the company's manager is female and equal to 0 otherwise. X is a vector of
control variables (age, experience of the manager, etc.), φj is a dummy variable that indicates the sector fixed effect,
and i, j, s, and t are indices that refer to the firm, the region, the sector, and the time, respectively.
5 | EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The objective of this section is to show the empirical results of the estimations on a binary choice model using logit.
5.1 | The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on female-led firms: results by firm size
and COVID-19 waves
To evaluate the dynamics of the impact of the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic on small firms led by
women, we estimate a COVID-19 wave logit model in which the dependent variable is the binary variable that
informs whether the firm has temporarily closed due to one of the three waves of COVID-19.
Table 4 presents the results on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female-led small firms in Morocco.
The study examines the relationship between several variables, including the age of the firm, manager experience,
subsidiary, size of the locality, and whether the firm is female-led and small. The data are presented across three
waves. The regression analysis shows that the age of the firm had a significant negative effect on business operations in the first wave, but this effect was not significant in subsequent waves. Manager experience had a positive
effect on business operations in the first wave, but this effect was not significant in the second and third waves.
1754 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
Being a subsidiary had a negative effect on business operations in all three waves. The size of the locality did not
have a significant effect on the business operations of these firms.
The empirical results (Table 4) show that the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on small firms tends to increase
since the second wave. Female-led firms were less affected by closure due to the COVID-19 crisis, a situation that
changed from the second wave of COVID-19, during which being a female-led firm increased the probability of being
closed due to the COVID-19 crisis by 3%. This negative impact of COVID-19 on this category of firms became more
pronounced in the third wave and thus statistically significant, as being a female-led firm increased the probability of
being closed due to the COVID-19 crisis by 16% in the third wave. Even in Europe the COVID-19 crisis has had a
severe impact on the prosperity of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have traditionally played a vital
role in the European economy. These SMEs, constituting more than two-thirds of the workforce and contributing more
than half of the economic value added, have faced significant challenges, as revealed by a recent McKinsey survey conducted in August 2020 (Dimson et al., 2020). The survey encompassed more than 2,200 SMEs across five European
countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The survey results highlighted the considerable concerns faced by SMEs as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, including potential loan defaults leading to employee layoffs,
the need to cancel growth projects, and a decline in revenues. Women entrepreneurs typically run smaller and more
vulnerable businesses, often in industries most affected by pandemic-related lockdowns. The temporary alterations
within work environments and permanent shutdowns of services and facilities have resulted in increased difficulties for
female entrepreneurs, specifically those who lead small and emerging businesses. Women who establish small enterprises to support their families are especially impacted, facing additional mental strain in such situations (Bharadwaj
et al., 2023). Elam et al. (2022) draw on data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), and the Facebook Future of Business Survey (FoBS) to investigate the pandemic's impact on
women entrepreneurs and business owners in emerging economies. The data shows that women were more likely to
report closing their business due to the pandemic than men globally, with women having an 18% increased likelihood
of business closure. Similar rates of business closures were reported by women and men in low-income countries.
However, Angola had an extremely high discontinuance rate for both women (35.5%) and men (23.2%).
Table 5 presents the estimates for the category of medium-sized firms in our sample. According to the results,
the age of the firm has a negative impact on the likelihood of temporary closure during the first wave of COVID-19.
Specifically, an increase in the natural logarithm of the firm's age by one unit is associated with a decrease in the

temporary closure by 0.0808. However, the age of the firm does not significantly affect the probability of temporary
closure during the second and third waves. Furthermore, manager experience has a positive impact on the likelihood
of temporary closure during the first wave of COVID-19. An increase in the natural logarithm of manager experience
by one unit is associated with an increase in the temporary closure by 0.0521. However, manager experience does
not significantly affect the probability of temporary closure during the second and third waves. Being a subsidiary
does not significantly affect the likelihood of temporary closure during any of the three waves. Similarly, the size of
the locality does not significantly affect the probability of temporary closure during the second and third waves.
Additionally, the impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on Moroccan medium-sized firms led by women are more
pronounced during the third wave of COVID-19. At the beginning of the third wave, being a medium-sized firm led
by a woman increased the probability of closure due to COVID-19 by 11%, but this result is not significant.
Overall, the findings indicate that the impact of different factors on the likelihood of temporary closure varies
across the different waves of COVID-19. The age of the firm and manager experience significantly predict the probability of temporary closure during the first wave, while the interaction between female-led firms and medium-sized
firms significantly predicts temporary closure during the third wave. Being a subsidiary and the size of the locality do
not significantly affect the probability of temporary closure during any of the three waves.
Table 6 presents the estimates of a logit model for large firms headed by women. One of the limits of our database is the relatively small number of large firms headed by women (18 firms) (Table 2) compared with the other categories of firms (small and medium-sized firms), a fact that caused the estimates of our model for the second and
third waves to be omitted, due to the absence of data on the variable ‘size*Top manager is female’, which led to a
collinearity problem in the estimates and consequently the variable ‘large firm*Top manager is female’ for the second and third waves was omitted. To overcome this problem, we transformed our database into a dynamic structure
that takes all three waves at the same time. The estimates of a logit model on the firm-level data for all three waves
and by firm size are presented in the following table:
The findings indicate that the age of the firm has a significant negative impact on the probability of temporary closure during all three waves of COVID-19. An increase in the natural logarithm of the age of the firm by one unit is associated with a decrease in the temporary closure by 0.0694. However, manager experience does not have a significant
effect on the probability of temporary closure during any of the three waves. Similarly, being a subsidiary and the size
of the locality do not have a significant effect on the probability of temporary closure during the three waves.

1756 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
The results of our logit model estimations by firm size highlighted that large firms were less affected by the
COVID-19 health crisis than the other two categories of firms, small and medium. Being a large firm led by a woman
reduced the probability of closing due to COVID-19 by 27%, which is significant. The results by firm size over the
three waves of COVID-19 (Table 7) confirm our results found previously, that small firms were the category most
affected by the COVID-19 crisis. A similar result was found by Boutafrout and Mdarbi (2021), who studied the
impact of the coronavirus on Moroccan very small and medium-sized enterprises. They used statistics from the High
Commission for Planning and an empirical study of 54 SMEs. Their results showed that those firms suffered most
from the fragility of their management system and the lack of financing. This result is consistent for other countries,
for example, Homayoun et al. (2023) examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging markets such as Iran, Iraq, and Jordan. The researchers used a standard questionnaire to
collect data from managers, accountants, and auditors in both listed and non-listed companies during the second
quarter of 2022. The findings indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the performance
of SMEs in these markets. Despite experiencing decreased financial and communication performance due to pandemic limitations, SMEs have adopted advanced technologies and methods, resulting in substantial changes in internal processes and increased innovation. Given its long-standing recommendation, innovation has been recognized as
a highly effective strategic response to crises (Wenzel et al., 2020). Markovic et al. (2021) demonstrated in their
study that the best approach to fostering innovation is by selecting suitable business partners. Through qualitative
data collected from SMEs in Bosnia and Herzegovina during March–April 2020, the researchers found that SMEs
have embraced new collaborations with both customers and competitors, adopting a collaborative mindset instead
of the traditional competitive approach in emerging markets.

the Enterprise Survey database was limited to surveying only nine regions. Table 8 presents the estimates of a logit
model incorporating the variables ‘Top manager is female* region of the firm’ to assess the impact of COVID-19 by
region. Our empirical results show that firms headed by female managers in the regions of Beni Mellal-Khenifra,
Drâa-Tafilalet, Oriental, and Marrakech-Safi are the firms most affected by the COVID-19 health crisis. It should be
noted that this result is statistically significant for firms led by women in the Oriental region. Female-led firms
located in the regions of Casablanca-Settat, Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, and Souss-Massa were less affected by the COVID19 health crisis.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about various challenges globally. These challenges include healthcare
needs, workplace harassment, economic downturn, energy consumption concerns, and food security issues (Zhuang
et al., 2022). The disruptions caused by the crisis have led to supply chain disruptions, reduced agricultural production, and difficulties in accessing nutritious food for vulnerable populations, without forgetting the sociocultural risk
factors that contribute to suicidal behavior emerging with the COVID-19 pandemic in the developing countries. Factors such as the fear of being infected, economic pressure, and lack of resources due to lockdown measures were
found to be major contributors to the increase in suicides (Shoib et al., 2021). As a low-middle-income and an agricultural country, Morocco has faced significant challenges. The studies that have analyzed the impact of the COVID-19
crisis on the Moroccan economy have shown that in times of crisis, the size of the informal sector affects the economic environment of the region (Ait Ali, El Aynaoui, et al., 2020; Haddad et al., 2020). Ait Ali, El Aynaoui, et al.
(2020) used a three-part empirical methodology (descriptive, econometric estimation, and input–output tables). Their
results found that the regions of Casablanca-Settat, Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, and Marrakech-Safi contribute the
most to national production and experienced the highest losses compared with the other regions. Similarly, the
empirical results obtained by Haddad et al. (2020), who studied the macroeconomic, sectoral, and regional impacts
of the preventive measures related to the COVID-19 crisis in Morocco, show a decline in GDP reaching 10.13% of
annual GDP, mainly concentrated in the regions (Casablanca-Settat; Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima; Marrakech-Safi;

Souss-Massa) that contribute most to the country's GDP. This study has mobilized the input–output analysis methodology on the basis of the hypothetical extraction approach. The comparison of these results with the results
obtained in our study leads us to conclude that the firms headed by women in our study, which are mainly part of
small and medium enterprises concentrated in the regions contributing the most to the national production, have
succeeded in reducing the impact of the coronavirus crisis by means of the governmental supports dedicated to the
companies the most exposed to the risks of the COVID-19 crisis. In fact, the policies and measures taken by
Morocco (payment of allowances to workers in the formal and informal sectors and public spending on health) have
made it possible to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the Moroccan economy by nearly two percentage
points (Haddad et al., 2020, p.14).
In sum, this paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Moroccan firms led by women,
specifically looking at whether the effects are short or long term, and how the different waves of the pandemic have
affected firms by size and region. The study uses a microeconomic database consisting of 1,096 Moroccan firms
observed during the first three waves of the pandemic. The results show that small firms were the most affected by
the crisis, and firms located in certain regions were also disproportionately affected. This study is unique in that it is
the first to empirically examine the impact of the health crisis in Morocco at the enterprise level, and it also examines
the impact on female-led firms by size and region. The study has implications for practice by identifying best practices for mitigating the impact of the crisis on firm sustainability, and for research by filling a gap in the literature by
investigating the impact of the crisis on firms by gender of the manager and at the meso-economic level.
In light of the study's results, several policy recommendations can be made with specific action points. Firstly,
providing targeted support for small firms and firms located in regions most affected by the pandemic is recommended. This support could include financial assistance in the form of grants or low interest loans, as well as
resources to help these firms adapt and recover. This could help mitigate the negative effects of the crisis on the sustainability of these firms and ensure their continued operation. Secondly, empowering and supporting female entrepreneurs is important. Programs and initiatives providing training, mentorship, access to funding, and networking
opportunities should be encouraged to create a support system for female entrepreneurs and encourage more
women to start and grow their businesses. Thirdly, investing in digital infrastructure and supporting the development
of digital skills is essential to facilitate the digital transition of firms and entrepreneurs. This will help small businesses
and entrepreneurs adapt to the new norm, increase their competitiveness, and be more resilient in the face of future
crises. Fourthly, encouraging economic diversification in regions that have been hit hard by the pandemic is recommended. This could include investing in new industries and providing support for businesses to diversify their
products or services, reducing dependence on certain sectors or industries, and mitigating the impact of future crises.
Fifthly, fostering collaboration and partnerships between firms, academia, and government is key. Sharing knowledge
and resources, as well as developing new products and services, will enable firms to better adapt to the new norm
and be more resilient. Lastly, providing tax relief, subsidies, and other incentives to firms that successfully adapt to
the new norm and continue to innovate is important. This will encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, allowing
firms to continue to grow and develop.
6 | DISCUSSION
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global economies and financial markets (Chen & ChiaWei, 2021), affecting various sectors and regions differently and leading to severe outcomes in terms of poverty and
welfare, especially in developing nations (Loayza, 2020). Understanding the heterogeneous nature of this impact is
crucial for formulating effective policies and interventions. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the
number of COVID-19 cases and lost economic growth across the Moroccan regions. Remarkably, the region with
the highest number of COVID-19 cases also experienced the most severe economic repercussions. This highlights
the interconnectedness of public health and economic outcomes during the pandemic, which is why health
1760 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
containment policies and economic support policies are complementary and highly effective in combating COVID-19
while preventing long-term economic decline (Leibovici & Famiglietti, 2022). By effectively controlling the virus,
health containment measures create a safer environment for economic recovery, while economic support policies
provide necessary financial stability for individuals and businesses, averting prolonged economic contraction. The
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on various sectors of the economy, with the tourism, hospitality, and
customer service industries being among the hardest hit (Alsamhi et al., 2022). These sectors rely heavily on travel,
social interaction, and customer engagement, all of which were severely disrupted by the pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic has had a profound effect on various characteristics of businesses, including their performance (Shen
et al., 2020), governance structure, liquidity, and level of leverage (Khatib & Nour, 2021). Small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) face heightened vulnerability compared with other types of firms, particularly during times of crisis due to their limited time and resources (Markovic et al., 2021). These constraints significantly impact the operations and performance of these firms (Homayoun et al., 2023; Veselinova & Samonikov, 2021). In the analysis of the
evolving impact of the health crisis on Moroccan female-led firms, by size in nine regions of Morocco, we find evidence of gender disparities, both in terms of firm closures and adaptability to the crisis. Our study reveals that the
impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on small firms has been increasing since the second wave, particularly on
female-led enterprises. This suggests that the challenges faced by these firms have intensified over time, posing a
growing threat to their survival and operations. Interestingly, female-led firms initially experienced a lower likelihood
of closure due to the COVID-19 crisis. However, this situation changed during the second wave, when female-led
firms exhibited a 3% increase in the probability of closure. The negative impact on this category of firms became
even more pronounced in the third wave, with a statistically significant 16% increase in the probability of closure for
female-led firms. The significant rise in closure probabilities for female-led firms during the third wave underscores
the enduring gender disparity in the impact of the health crisis on businesses. Additionally, by examining the genderbased differences in the impact of the health crisis on the effectiveness of adjustment measures employed, we
observed a heterogeneous impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the basis of the gender of the firm's leader. This
suggests that gender may play a role in determining the extent of the economic impact experienced by firms. Furthermore, the impact varied between different survey periods, indicating the evolving nature of the pandemic and its
effects on businesses. These findings underline the need for timely and context-specific interventions to mitigate
negative consequences. Initially, the adjustment measures implemented by firms, regardless of the gender of the
firm's leader, were largely identical. This suggests that in the early stages of the pandemic, the response strategies
were similar among male- and female-led firms. However, as the crisis progressed, there were differences in the
impact of the pandemic on female-led firms compared with male-led firms. Indicators related to the situation and
performance of firms during the health crisis, such as the percentage of firms that closed definitively or temporarily,
revealed that female-led firms were more affected during the COVID-19 crisis.
Additionally, the gap in adaptability to the changes brought about by the crisis continued to persist, depending
on the gender of the firm's leader. This suggests that female-led enterprises faced greater challenges in adapting to
the evolving circumstances during the pandemic. The rapid implementation of policy adaptation measures emerged
as a crucial factor in reducing the impact of the health crisis on male-led enterprises. We find that firms headed by
female managers in the regions of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Drâa-Tafilalet, Oriental, and Marrakech-Safi are among the
most affected by the COVID-19 health crisis. Notably, the impact on female-led firms in the Oriental region is statistically significant, emphasizing the severity of the challenges faced by businesses in that area. Conversely, female-led
firms located in the regions of Casablanca-Settat, Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, and Souss-Massa were relatively less affected
by the COVID-19 health crisis. These regions exhibited a comparatively lower impact on female-led firms, indicating
a variation in the level of vulnerability and resilience across different geographic areas. This finding underscores the
importance of prompt policy responses in mitigating the economic consequences of the pandemic. It further emphasizes the need for gender-sensitive interventions to address the disproportionate impact faced by female-led firms
and to promote equitable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.

7 | CONCLUSION
This study explores the effects of the COVID-19 health crisis on female-led firms in Morocco, categorized by size and
region. Our preliminary analysis reveals that female-led firms were more severely affected by the crisis than male-led
firms, largely due to differences in policy adaptation. Specifically, male-led firms were quicker to adapt, thereby minimizing the impact of the crisis on their businesses. To assess the impact of the crisis on firms in Morocco, we used microlevel data from a sample of 1,096 firms from 9 of the country's 12 regions. The Guelmim-Oued Noun region, the
Laayoune-Saguia El Hamra region, and the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region were not included in the survey. The findings
of the research indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on small firms, particularly those
located in the regions of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Drâa-Tafilalet, Oriental, and Marrakech-Safi. The study used a logit
model of COVID-19 to estimate the effects on different categories of firms. The results suggest that small firms were
more severely affected than large firms. The analysis further reveals that the government's support has been directed
toward firms located in regions that contribute the most to national production and were most affected by the epidemic. This approach has helped to reduce the impact of the pandemic on these firms and their activities.
Overall, this study fills a gap in the existing literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on firms. It provides empirical evidence on the challenges that female firm managers have faced during the crisis situation. By
highlighting the differential impact of the pandemic on small and large firms and on different regions, this study contributes to the development of more targeted policy responses to support firms in these challenging times. Our
study's implications provide valuable insights to policymakers and useful information for scientific readership.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco has compelled business leaders and owners to swiftly mobilize and make
prompt decisions, such as reducing industrial output or temporarily ceasing operations. These decisions may have
unanticipated long-term consequences. The implementation of government lockdown policies has significantly
influenced the performance of businesses. Therefore, it is essential for firms to have a scalable and effective emergency plan in place, ready to respond to unexpected events (Alsamhi et al., 2022). Furthermore, this pandemic serves
as a valuable learning opportunity for businesses, enabling them to better prepare for future similar challenges. Our
study provides evidence of the challenges that female-led firms faced during the pandemic. Women are the backbone of communities across the globe, and their businesses have a profound impact on uplifting families, communities, and societies as a whole (OECD Network, 2021). They have exhibited their aptitude in not only handling small
enterprises, but also in turning them into highly profitable large industries (Bharadwaj et al., 2023). Our study reveals
that small firms have been more severely affected by the pandemic, especially those led by women in some regions.
It is imperative to prioritize the establishment of a business environment that acknowledges and addresses the
unique needs and contributions of women. These findings call for targeted policies and interventions that address
the specific challenges faced by female-led enterprises and promote gender equality in the face of future crises.
Governments and policymakers have a vital role in securing the long-term presence of women entrepreneurs
and their businesses. To begin with, it is crucial to ensure the survival and growth of women entrepreneurs during
the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing targeted fiscal support packages specifically tailored for women-owned
micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Placing women entrepreneurs at the forefront of economic
policies and promoting equal access to finance from all available sources necessitates the elimination of discriminatory practices in the loan application process. Additionally, legislators should promptly assess and revoke policies and
regulations that discriminate against women entrepreneurs or hinder their business achievements. Lastly, we urge
governments to endorse the collection, analysis, and dissemination of gender-specific data on MSMEs and entrepreneurship. This will enable legislation, policies, support packages, and financial products and services to be developed
with the consideration of the unique needs of women entrepreneurs.
COVID-19 has the potential to reshape society beyond the realm of health, and the response from innovation is
expected to address these transformations. As new challenges arise, the speed at which organizations can introduce
innovative solutions becomes just as crucial as other managerial actions required during a crisis (Ebersberger &
Kuckertz, 2021). Furthermore, to adapt to the challenges brought about by the pandemic, firms have increasingly
1762 ELOUARDIGHI and OUBEJJA
turned to digital solutions to enable remote work, virtual communication, online transactions, and other essential
operations. This rapid adoption of digital technologies has allowed businesses to continue functioning amid social
distancing measures and restrictions on physical interactions. Consequently, it is crucial for policymakers to recognize the importance of investing in digital technologies and infrastructure. By increasing funding in this area,
policymakers can support businesses in their digital transformation efforts. This includes improving access to highspeed internet, investing in cybersecurity measures, providing resources for digital skills training, and facilitating the
development and implementation of innovative digital tools and platforms. By enhancing investment in digital technologies, policymakers can help businesses not only navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, but also build
resilience for future crises. Embracing digital transformation allows businesses to adapt quickly, operate remotely,
reach customers through online channels, and maintain business continuity even when faced with disruptions. Overall, increasing investment in digital technologies is a strategic step toward ensuring the long-term success and resilience of businesses in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. These recommendations aim to support the sustainability
of firms, promote economic recovery, and encourage a more resilient and inclusive economy.
In terms of limitations, we faced a lack of data availability. The sample size of 1,096 Moroccan firms may not be
representative of all female-led firms in Morocco, and the data extracted from the ‘Enterprise Survey: impact on
firms’ database of the World Bank may have limitations in terms of the variables included or the accuracy of the
data. Future research could explore the impact of COVID-19 on other types of firms in Morocco, such as male-led
firms or firms in different industries. Further investigation could also be conducted to analyze the long-term impacts
of the pandemic on female-led firms in Morocco and how they are adapting to the changing business landscape. A
comparative analysis could also be conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on female-led firms in
Morocco compared with other countries in the region or globally. Future studies could investigate the effectiveness
of different policy interventions aimed at supporting female-led firms during and after the pandemic. Additionally,
research could explore the impact of other factors, such as access to finance, technology, or government support, on
the resilience of female-led firms in Morocco.

Resumen. Este estudio examina los efectos de la pandemia causada por el coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) en las
empresas marroquíes dirigidas por mujeres, para lo cual considera tanto las repercusiones a corto como a largo plazo.
En él se investiga la influencia en estas empresas de las distintas oleadas de la pandemia, teniendo en cuenta su tamaño y ubicación, para obtener valiosas perspectivas sobre sus estrategias de gestión de crisis. Se partió de una base
de datos a nivel micro constituida por 1.096 empresas marroquíes observadas durante las tres oleadas iniciales de la
pandemia, y con ella se extrajeron datos de la base de datos ‘Enterprise Survey: impact on firms’ del Banco Mundial.
El análisis utilizó un modelo logit y mostró que el impacto de la pandemia varió en función del género del jefe de la
empresa y del periodo de la encuesta. Las empresas dirigidas por mujeres se vieron más afectadas por la crisis sanitaria que las dirigidas por hombres. La rápida aplicación de adaptaciones políticas desempeñó un papel crucial en la
reducción del impacto de la crisis sanitaria sobre las empresas dirigidas por hombres. Las pequeñas empresas, sobre
todo las situadas en regiones como Beni Mellal‐Khenifra, Drâa‐Tafilalet, Oriental y Marrakech‐Safi, se vieron muy
afectadas por la crisis del COVID‐19. Este estudio aporta dos contribuciones clave. En primer lugar, ofrece un análisis
empírico del impacto de la pandemia en las empresas marroquíes utilizando datos a nivel de empresa, algo sin
precedentes en Marruecos. En segundo lugar, investiga las repercusiones de la pandemia en las empresas marroquíes
de distintos tamaños y regiones dirigidas por mujeres, y reconoce el impacto desproporcionado en las mujeres durante las crisis económicas. El estudio trata de ofrecer aportaciones valiosas para apoyar la recuperación de las
empresas dirigidas por mujeres en el futuro. Los resultados subrayan la importancia de la ayuda específica a las
pequeñas empresas y a las situadas en las regiones afectadas para mitigar las consecuencias de la crisis y fomentar la
reactivación económica. Estas empresas desempeñan un papel crucial en la economía local, por lo que es esencial
apoyar su supervivencia y resiliencia en la era posterior a COVID‐19.
