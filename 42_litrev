# Literature Review The fabrication of consumer interest in the EU FinTech

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of technology has led to the transformation of payment infrastructures into the
platform economy. This paper aims to investigate how certain socio-technical imaginaries about technology filter into EU policymaking, thereby influencing and accelerating this transformation. Specifically,
the research focuses on the integration of digital payments into the platform economy and the role of EU
policies in shaping this process. By conducting a qualitative analysis of official documents, the study
sheds light on the imaginaries surrounding technology and their impact on the portrayal of consumers
and the vulnerability of consumers in relation to data-intensive payment technologies.

## Imaginaries Shaping EU Policymaking

The research conducted by Glasze et al. (2022) explores how imaginaries about technology influence EU
policymaking. The authors argue that these imaginaries play a significant role in allowing or accelerating
the transformation of payment infrastructures into the platform economy. By analyzing official documents, Glasze et al. reveal that the EU policymaking process is informed by specific images of the consumer,
which serve to justify measures for realizing a desired future. These imaginaries depict the consumer as
an empowered actor in the digital era, highlighting the benefits of digitization. However, it is important to
note that this view of the consumer is partial, as it tends to overshadow crucial considerations regarding
the vulnerability of consumers in relation to data-intensive payment technologies.

## Consumer Technological Empowerment and Vulnerability

The research findings suggest that the rhetoric of consumer technological empowerment outweighs
the acknowledgement of consumer vulnerability in the realm of digital payments. The EU documents
analyzed in the study emphasize the positive aspects of consumer empowerment through digitization.
This perspective aligns with the socio-technical imaginaries that shape EU policymaking, promoting the
benefits of technology-driven payment infrastructures. However, the research highlights a knowledge
gap in terms of addressing and adequately considering the vulnerability of consumers in the context of
data-intensive payment technologies.

## Interconnections between Technological Features and EU Legal Framework

In exploring the interconnections between traditional and cutting-edge technological features of virtual
currencies and the EU legal framework, the research highlights the challenges posed by Distributed Ledger
Technologies (DLTs). The study emphasizes the double-edged nature of DLTs and their implications

for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. The concept of pseudonymity and traceability
is explored in relation to privacy-enhancing mechanisms and blockchain intelligence strategies. The
research identifies key controversies and open questions regarding the feasibility of applying the "active
cooperation" approach to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing in crypto ecosystems.

## Future Research Directions

The literature review reveals several knowledge gaps and suggests potential future research directions in
the field of platformisation, digital payments, infrastructures, EU policy, and socio-technical imaginaries.
Firstly, there is a need for further investigation into the socio-technical imaginaries that shape EU
policymaking and their influence on the transformation of payment infrastructures. This could involve
analyzing additional official documents and conducting interviews with policymakers to gain a more
comprehensive understanding of the processes involved.
Secondly, future research should focus on addressing the knowledge gap regarding the vulnerability of
consumers in the context of data-intensive payment technologies. This could involve conducting empirical
studies to assess the actual risks faced by consumers and exploring potential mechanisms for mitigating
these risks.
Furthermore, there is a need for more in-depth research on the interconnections between technological
features of virtual currencies and the EU legal framework. This could involve examining specific case
studies and conducting comparative analyses of different regulatory approaches across EU member states.
Finally, future research should explore the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the "active cooperation" approach to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing in crypto ecosystems. This
could involve assessing the practical challenges and ethical implications of such an approach, as well as
exploring alternative regulatory strategies.
In conclusion, this literature review has examined the interplay between socio-technical imaginaries,
EU policymaking, and the transformation of payment infrastructures into the platform economy. The
findings highlight the partial view of consumers as empowered actors in the digital era, while neglecting
considerations of consumer vulnerability. The review also emphasizes the challenges and controversies
surrounding the integration of cutting-edge technological features into the EU legal framework. The identified knowledge gaps suggest potential future research directions in the field, including the exploration
of socio-technical imaginaries, consumer vulnerability, and regulatory strategies in the context of digital
payments and EU policy.
