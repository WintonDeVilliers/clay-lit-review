# Literature Review: Determinants of Emerging Technologies Adoption in the South African Financial

Sector

## Introduction

The adoption of emerging technologies is crucial for organizations to stay competitive and achieve growth
in today's digital era. Understanding the determinants of technology adoption is essential for the successful
implementation and utilization of these technologies in various sectors, including the financial sector. This
literature review aims to explore the determinants of emerging technologies adoption in the South African
financial sector, synthesizing the findings from relevant research studies.

## Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Cryptocurrency Adoption

One research study by Mutambara (2019) applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to predict the
behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa. The TPB suggests that attitude, subjective
norm, and perceived behavioural control influence an individual's intention to adopt a specific behaviour.
The findings of the study indicated that attitude and perceived behavioural control had a positive impact
on the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. However, subjective norm showed a negative non-significant
influence (Mutambara, 2019).

## Cloud Computing Adoption in Saudi Healthcare Organizations

While the specific focus of the research study by Alharbi, Atkins, and Stanier (2016) was on cloud
computing adoption in Saudi healthcare organizations, some of the findings can be relevant to the adoption
of emerging technologies in the South African financial sector. The study identified several determinants
of cloud computing adoption, including perceived benefits, perceived risks, organizational readiness, top
management support, and IT infrastructure. The findings highlighted the significance of these determinants in influencing the adoption decision and successful implementation of cloud computing (Alharbi,
Atkins, & Stanier, 2016).

## Synthesis and Integration of Findings

Integrating the findings from Mutambara's (2019) study on cryptocurrency adoption and Alharbi et
al.'s (2016) study on cloud computing adoption, it can be inferred that attitude, perceived benefits, and
perceived risks play crucial roles in determining the adoption of emerging technologies in the financial
sector. The positive impact of attitude and perceived behavioural control found in the cryptocurrency
adoption study aligns with the importance of perceived benefits and organizational readiness identified in
the cloud computing adoption study.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing research provides valuable insights into the determinants of emerging technologies
adoption in the South African financial sector, there are some knowledge gaps that can be addressed
in future research. Firstly, there is a need to explore the specific determinants of adoption for different
types of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things, within
the financial sector in South Africa. This would allow for a deeper understanding of the unique factors
influencing the adoption of each technology.
Secondly, future research could investigate the role of organizational culture and change management in
the adoption of emerging technologies. Organizational culture and the ability to manage change effectively
are critical factors that can either facilitate or hinder the adoption process. Understanding how these
factors interact with the determinants identified in previous studies can provide a more comprehensive
understanding of technology adoption in the financial sector.
Lastly, it would be valuable to conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of technology
adoption on organizational performance and competitiveness in the South African financial sector. Such
studies can provide insights into the sustainability and effectiveness of technology adoption strategies and
inform future decision-making processes.
In conclusion, the determinants of emerging technologies adoption in the South African financial sector
are complex and multifaceted. The findings from studies on cryptocurrency adoption and cloud computing
adoption highlight the importance of attitude, perceived benefits, perceived risks, organizational readiness,
and other factors in influencing the adoption decision. However, there are still knowledge gaps that need
to be addressed through future research to gain a deeper understanding of the adoption process and its
impact on organizational outcomes.
