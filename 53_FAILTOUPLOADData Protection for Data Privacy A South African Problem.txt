Abstract: June 16, 2023
This study proposes a comprehensive framework for enhancing data security and privacy within organizations through data protection
awareness. It employs a quantitative method and survey research strategy to assess the level of data protection awareness among
employees of a public organization. Pre- and post-questionnaires, along with an explanatory poster and a video discussion, are utilized to
evaluate participants’ understanding of data protection. The study aims to identify misconceptions about data protection by comparing
the results. Continuous promotion of data protection awareness is recommended, particularly in hybrid working environments,
emphasizing the importance of understanding the eight conditions of POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act). The findings of this
study contribute to strengthening data protection practices and cultivating a culture of data privacy within organizations. Keywords:

1. INTRODUCTION
The implementation of the Protection of Personal
Information Act (POPIA) and the shift to remote work during
the pandemic presented challenges that required
organizations to invest resources in promoting data
protection awareness. However, it is crucial for employees
to fully understand their responsibilities in implementing
the training they have received and complying with the Act.
Employees directly involved in handling organizational data
play a vital role in ensuring data protection compliance and
implementing effective measures. Access to information
and knowledge significantly impacts an employee’s ability
to effectively execute data protection awareness. Sayers
proposes a seven-step process for raising awareness,
including identifying the subject, generating employee
interest, building skills and optimism, providing facilitation,
using simulations to encourage action, and reinforcing the
message [1]. Data privacy faces two major threats. The first
threat is the expanding influence of the internet and social
media, which amplify the capabilities of data protection and
surveillance. This leads individuals to unintentionally or
knowingly disclose private information. The second, more
significant threat is the growing significance and
dependence on information in decision-making processes.
Policymakers prioritize the value of information, even if it
comes at the cost of compromising privacy rights [2]. People
are increasingly sharing their private information, both
consciously and unconsciously. Additionally, there is a more
significant and concerning threat related to the growing
reliance on information for decision-making. Policymakers,
as highlighted by Mason [3], prioritize the value of
information, even if it involves compromising the privacy of
individuals. Despite the Generalised Agreement on
Accounting Principles (GAAP) not recognizing digital
personal data as an asset on balance sheets, major
technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,
Google (Alphabet), and Facebook (Meta) have effectively
turned data into a valuable asset [4], [4]. Recognizing the
significance of data, its protection, and the potential risks
associated with its misuse is of utmost importance.
Organizations that collect and handle personal data bear the
responsibility of safeguarding it through secure data
management practices [3]. The value of data extends
beyond organizations that offer products and services to
consumers, as it has demonstrated considerable worth to
cybercriminals [5], [6], [7].
A. Research Objective
To achieve the research objective, a quantitative survey
methodology was utilized to gather valuable feedback.
Additionally, in order to promote data protection awareness
in various work settings, employees were provided with a
poster (Figure 1) and a video containing insights on data
protection. The secondary objectives outlined below aim to
further enhance and strengthen the primary objective of
this research study. The objective of the pre-questionnaire
is to assess the current level of data protection awareness
among employees after they have undergone training. The
objectives of the post-questionnaire are to assess the
employee’s understanding of the POPIA conditions and their
awareness of organizational policies and procedures related
to data protection.

Additionally, it aims to investigate how employees apply
their data protection knowledge in a hybrid working
environment, considering different processing conditions.
The diagram depicted in Figure 2 illustrates the
implementation of data protection awareness by
employees. The primary research question for this study
focuses on how employees apply their data protection
training to ensure compliance with POPIA regulations during
the processing of personal information. The objective of this
research, depicted in Figure 3, is to investigate the effective
application of data protection awareness by employees in
remote and on-site working environments, while also
assessing their understanding of data protection following
training.

awareness
B. The Privacy Concept
According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, privacy is
defined as the right of individuals to maintain the
confidentiality of their personal affairs and relationships [8],
encompassing personal space, information, and thoughts
that are not meant to be shared.
Data privacy, although lacking a legal definition, plays a
crucial role in preventing malicious use of data by
cybercriminals [9], [10], [11]. Scholars in the field have
attempted to classify privacy concerns and intrusion
categories, such as the taxonomy proposed by Finn and
Wright [12], which outlines seven types of privacy as
presented in Table I. Alan Westin [13] extensively examines
the conflict between privacy and surveillance in modern
society, exploring the societal significance of privacy and its
various functions. While data and information have distinct
definitions, they are frequently used interchangeably.
Figure 3. Research scope overview
The field of data protection can be classified into three
primary domains: traditional data protection, data security,
and data privacy (see Figure 4).
Figure 4. Data privacy, security, and protection
Data, as defined by Baskarada [14], encompasses
discrete pieces of information that may or may not be
directly linked to a specific individual, possessing both
quantitative and qualitative characteristics [15]. On the
other hand, information is the result of combining various
data attributes, providing deeper knowledge and
understanding of a particular subject [14], [15]. Although
the definitions of data and information privacy vary, they
share a common focus on the management of personal
information, with slight variations, as noted by Belanger et
al. [16] and Rossi [15], leading to diverse and numerous
challenges regarding privacy.
C. Data Protection Guidelines
In this section, we delve into the data protection
guidelines established by South African legislation.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge that data protection
awareness and implementation should extend beyond mere
compliance with legal requirements. As Doctorow [17]
highlights, technological advancements and the internet
present ongoing possibilities for the exploitation of
information and data, even in the presence of regulatory
oversight. Jordaan [18] has raised concerns regarding
privacy, specifically addressing issues related to the
collection of personal information, biases in data
management, unauthorized access, and the potential
misuse of sensitive data. Despite the existence of
information protection legislation, certain government
entities are exempt from data protection measures [19].
The exemption mentioned above highlights the
challenge of striking a balance between the human right to
privacy and the protection provided by governments to
their citizens [20]. Furthermore, South Africa has witnessed
a significant increase in cyber-attacks, with nearly 60% of
the population utilizing various online devices [21], [22].
Cybercriminals focus their efforts on critical systems in
order to infiltrate organizations and access valuable data
and information [23]. Thus, it is crucial to establish robust
data protection measures to mitigate these risks.

In South Africa, the annual cost of cybercrime
victimization for the public amounts to approximately R2.2
billion, positioning the country as the second-highest in
Africa for cybercrime incidents [24]. Cyber-attacks pose not
only financial risks but also political and military threats,
emphasizing the importance of data protection [23]. South
Africa faces significant cyber security challenges, as
reflected in its ranking as the fifth most affected country
globally by cybercriminal activities (Figure 5). This ranking is
based on the ratio of cybercrime victims per 1 million
internet users, reported to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) from 2021 to 2022 [25], [26], [27]. Data
protection awareness has become increasingly crucial in
South Africa following cyberattacks such as the Dis-Chem
and TransUnion breaches.
These attacks resulted in the compromise of millions of
personal records, highlighting the need to safeguard the
confidential information of stakeholders, partners,
employees, and customers. The hacker group
N4aughtysecTU was responsible for orchestrating these
breaches. 1
. Moreover, numerous South African
organizations, including Experian, City of Johannesburg,
Ster-Kinekor, FNB, Standard Bank, ABSA, Telkom, the
Department of Justice, Transnet, Uber Hack, and
Momentum Metropolitan, have fallen victim to
cybercrimes, as documented in a study by Akinbowale et al.
[28].

These incidents underscore the urgent need for
enhanced data protection and security measures in South
Africa. According to a 2017 study that examined South
African data, the most prevalent types of cyber-attacks in
the country are data exposure and financial theft [28]. The
incident involving the former Public Protector Advocate
Thuli Madonsela in South Africa highlights the importance
of data protection, as she experienced a WhatsApp scam
resulting in financial loss.1Madonsela shared her ordeal on
Twitter, revealing how her friend’s WhatsApp account was
hacked, and the hacker demanded money over several
months. This incident serves as a clear example of the need
to prioritize data security in South Africa. Van Niekerk (2017)
conducted an analysis of 54 cyber incidents, focusing on the
potential impacts of various types of attacks, including
Denial of Services (DoS), defacement, data corruption,
system penetration, men in the middle, financial theft, and
data exposure. The study revealed that data exposure and
data corruption accounted for 45% of the overall impact of
cyber incidents. Additionally, it was found that 54% of cyber
attacks targeted state or political entities in South Africa.
The prioritization of data protection measures varies among
organizations [29]. Netshakhuma and Nkholedzeni [30]
noted that public entities in South Africa generate critical
information and data required for ensuring compliance with
the country’s laws and regulations.
Figure 6. Analysis of cyber incidents in South Africa (Niekerk [21])
Ensuring data protection and compliance with POPIA
regulations is crucial for the South African organization as
they collect and process customer information. These
organization must implement several measures to align with
the requirements of POPIA. Figure 7 presents a comparison
between POPIA compliance and the factors that impact the
new normal of South Africans working and learning in a
hybrid environment.

Figure 7. Employee’s adherence and application of personal
information
The comparison involves assessing the following aspects:
employees’ knowledge gaps regarding POPIA compliance,
the necessity of compliance in any working environment,
and adherence to organizational policies, standards, and
procedures for data protection.
D. The South African Data Privacy Legislation
The South African Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development introduced the POPIA on 14
December 2018, allowing organizations a one-year grace
period to comply with its requirements [31]. To prepare for
enforcement, many organizations established policies and
codes of conduct as guidelines for information protection.
The POPIA was officially promulgated by the president on 1
July 2020, aiming to ensure ethical management of data
protection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa
enforced a National State of Disaster from 15 March 2020
to 4 April 2022, which resulted in a nationwide lockdown
with varying alert levels. This period coincided with the
implementation of the POPIA by many organizations in
South Africa, as they adapted to new work arrangements
such as office-based, home-based, or hybrid models [32],
[31]. The introduction of these new work arrangements
played a crucial role in promoting data protection
awareness and ensuring its effective enforcement
throughout organizations. The primary goal of the POPIA is
to ensure the security of sensitive data handled by South
African organizations and to regulate the transfer of
personal information across national borders. The Act
outlines eight conditions (Table II) that require data
protection awareness and compliance at all levels within
organizations. In order to safeguard personal information,
several countries, including South Africa with the POPIA and
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as
highlighted by David Banisar [27], have implemented
measures to protect personal data. The reason behind this
progress is that the recognition of data protection as a
crucial component of human rights and privacy has led to its
widespread adoption. Figure 8 demonstrates the status of
data protection implementation across countries in 2023,
including those that have successfully enacted it, those in 
the process of enacting it, and those lacking any data
protection initiatives, such as the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
Figure 8. National comprehensive data protection/privacy laws and bills
(Banisar [27])
To ensure the protection of people’s privacy, a multitude
of data protection legislations have been implemented
worldwide. Banisar [27] emphasizes the progress made on
an international scale from December 2016 to August 2023.
Figure 8 clearly illustrates the evolving global landscape of
data protection. South Africa has implemented various laws
and regulations, including the Protection of Personal
Information Act (POPIA), to safeguard privacy. These
measures are rooted in the Constitution, which guarantees
the right to privacy and explicitly mentions the right to
communication privacy. The South African Electronic
Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA) regulates
electronic communication and includes data protection
principles for data collectors to follow. Additionally, the
Cybercrimes Act of 2020 addresses cybercrime offenses and
imposes penalties for unauthorized data access, website
tampering, virus insertion, and fraudulent activities for
financial gain. The Cybercrimes Act provides guidelines for
addressing cybercrimes and malicious communications of
private data, as outlined in Chapter 2 of the Act.
This study posits that South African organisation’s
employees have access to information and security policies
that guide them in managing, processing, and protecting
data in accordance with the protection guidelines
established by these Acts.
2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This research aims to propose a framework for assessing
employees’ awareness, responsibility, and accountability
towards data security in the context of data protection.
Specifically, it focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of
training provided during the implementation of the
Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). The study
explores the level of employees’ knowledge and application
of data protection principles, considering the unique
circumstances of remote work during the COVID-19
pandemic. It investigates challenges faced by employees in
implementing data protection practices while working from
home and examines the influence of organizational culture
on promoting a data protection mindset. Additionally, the
research examines the impact of the hybrid work
environment on data protection practices and awareness
among employees. The research seeks to make a valuable
contribution by developing a framework for enhancing data
protection awareness in a hybrid work environment, thus
ensuring the security of employees’ data. This study adopts
a research methodology based on the research onion
framework introduced by Saunders et al. [33]. The selection
of research options aligns with the different layers of the
research onion, as illustrated in Figure 9.
These options, including the philosophical stance, approach
to theory development, methodological choice, research
strategy, and time horizon, are elaborated in subsequent
subsections to provide a comprehensive understanding. By
employing this methodological approach, the study aims to
conduct a systematic and rigorous investigation into the
research problem at hand.

Figure 9. The research methodology (Saunders et al. [33])
A. Research Philosophy
Saunders et al. [33] proposed a research onion
framework that includes various philosophical positions.
The four main positions are positivism, interpretivism,
realism, and pragmatism. Positivism emphasizes objective
research with empirical and measurable data.
Interpretivism acknowledges subjectivity and focuses on
understanding the social and cultural context [33]. Realism
combines empirical data and theoretical concepts to
understand an objective reality. Pragmatism advocates for a
flexible approach depending on the research problem [33].
These philosophical positions influence the research
approach, methods, and data interpretation. In this study, a
positivist research philosophy was adopted to ensure
objectivity in data collection and interpretation. We aim to
maintain minimal interaction with participants to remain
independent. The positivist philosophy aligns with the belief
that knowledge can be obtained through empirical
observation and scientific methods. It is suitable for
hypothesis testing and establishing causal relationships
using empirical data.
B. Research Approach
This study proposes a deductive research approach
based on the research onion model proposed by Saunders
et al. [33]. The deductive involves the use of questionnaires
to gather empirical data and compare different
perspectives. It starts with a theory and formulate
hypotheses or questions, which were tested through data
collection. In contrast to the inductive approach that seeks
to gain insights into the meaning attached to events, the
deductive approach followed a structured process with
controls in place to ensure the validity of the collected data.
The study’s outcomes can be analyzed to determine
whether the hypotheses formulated for the research are
confirmed or rejected.
C. Research Choice
The selected methodological approach for this study
aligns with Saunders’ research onion model [33] and is
categorized as a mono quantitative method. This approach
differs from mixed and multi-method research, as it solely
focuses on either qualitative or quantitative data collection
and analysis techniques. In this particular study, a mono
method quantitative approach is proposed to ensure
objectivity and precision in capturing participants’
responses. This approach enabled efficient and timely data
collection.
D. Data Collection and Data Analysis
Figure 10 illustrates the data collection process
proposed in this study. Two surveys are designed using
Microsoft Forms to gather the necessary data. The first
survey focused on assessing participants’ understanding of
data protection, specifically in relation to the training
received on the POPIA. The training for participants in this
study can be conducted remotely through the use of
animated videos, followed by a test focusing on a specific
condition related to the POPIA. After being exposed to a
data protection-related poster artifact, participants can
complete a second survey. Additionally, a video can be
provided to further explain the content of the poster after
the initial survey completion. The surveys can consist of
True or False questions, Likert Rating scale questions, and
questions allowing for multiple answers. The questions in
the second survey can be primarily based on the main
themes presented in the poster. The study proposes a
comparative analysis to assess the level of data protection
awareness among participants before and after their
exposure to the poster and the accompanying explanatory
video. Table III provides an overview of the research
methodology proposed in this study.
E. Data Analysis Method
Future works can aim to ascertain the level of data
protection awareness among participants by employing a
quantitative approach to data analysis. By utilizing
numerical data, researchers can process and extract
meaningful insights, which can be presented using charts,
graphs, and statistics. The survey questionnaire can be
designed to collect both opinions and factual data, with
predefined answers to specific questions generating the
latter. Following data collection, an exploratory and
descriptive analysis can be conducted to gain a deeper
understanding of the collected data. Researchers can then
design and carry out research experiments to further
investigate the level of data protection awareness among
participants. Ultimately, these future works can contribute
to a comprehensive conclusion regarding the participants’
awareness of data protection.
Figure 10. Outline of the research process
3. LIMITATIONS
While numerous organizations have implemented
initiatives to enhance data protection awareness, this study
focuses exclusively on South African organizations and their
workforce. Consequently, the framework presented in this
research is limited to the context of South Africa.
Furthermore, several limitations were identified within
this study. Firstly, there might be challenges associated with
the research sample and the selection process, potentially
introducing bias into the study. Secondly, the sample size of
the study may not be extensive enough to detect significant
relationships within the data, despite efforts made to obtain
a sizable sample. These limitations should be considered
when interpreting the findings of this research. One
significant limitation identified in this study is the lack of
previous research on the POPIA. This knowledge gap hinders
the ability to build upon existing literature and make
meaningful comparisons. To address this limitation, further
research should focus on assessing data protection
awareness specifically within the context of the POPIA. This
will contribute to a better understanding of data protection
practices and aid in the development of effective strategies
to safeguard data.
4. CONCLUSION
Assessing the level of data protection awareness among
employees is a challenging task for organizations. While
achieving optimal effectiveness in this area may be difficult,
identifying gaps and deficiencies serves as a valuable
starting point. To attain organizational objectives, the
presence of policies, standards, procedures, and business
processes is crucial, with employees playing a significant
role in their implementation. With this in mind, this research
investigated the impact of data protection awareness,
taking into account individual employee preferences and
circumstances that influence productivity. Sustained and
ongoing refresher training and awareness initiatives are
essential to ensure consistent and improved
implementation of data protection measures.
