# Literature Review: Australia's National Broadband Network - A Cybersecure Critical Infrastructure?

## Introduction

Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) is a significant infrastructure project aimed at providing
high-speed broadband connectivity to 93% of homes and businesses in the country. The NBN is expected
to enhance productivity, improve education and healthcare delivery, and serve as the foundation for the
21st-century telecommunications network. However, the cybersecurity of this critical infrastructure is
a matter of concern, given the increasing risks posed by cyber threats. This literature review aims to
analyze existing research findings related to Australia's National Broadband Network and its cybersecurity
implications.

## Cybersecurity Risks and Challenges

The implementation of the NBN brings forth various cybersecurity risks and challenges that need to be
addressed for ensuring a cybersecure critical infrastructure. The research by Wilson (2009) highlights the
concerns regarding the lack of bi-partisan support for the NBN project. The absence of consensus on the
project's execution and governance raises questions about the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures in
the NBN.
Furthermore, the research by Selby (2017) emphasizes the need to address cybersecurity risks through
data localization laws. These laws can be considered a legitimate response to cybersecurity risks and can
help mitigate potential threats to the NBN infrastructure. Data localization can ensure that sensitive data
is stored within the country, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and cyber attacks.

## The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

To establish a robust cybersecurity framework for the NBN, the research by White and Sjelin (2021) suggests implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The NIST framework provides a comprehensive
set of guidelines and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. By adopting this framework, the
NBN can enhance its cybersecurity posture and effectively respond to emerging threats.

## Human-Centric Approach to Cybersecurity

The research by Deibert (2018) advocates for a human-centric approach to cybersecurity. This approach
emphasizes the importance of considering human factors, such as user behavior and awareness, in designing and implementing cybersecurity measures. Implementing a human-centric cybersecurity approach
in the NBN project can enhance the overall security of the infrastructure by addressing the human

vulnerabilities exploited by cyber attackers.

## Cybersecurity Law and Regulation

Effective cybersecurity law and regulation play a crucial role in ensuring the security of critical infrastructure like the NBN. The research by Gorian (2020) highlights the Cybersecurity Law of the People's
Republic of China as a key instrument for ensuring the information security of the banking and finance
system. Drawing insights from this research, Australia can develop and implement robust cybersecurity
laws and regulations to safeguard the NBN infrastructure.

## Critical Infrastructure Protection Approaches

The research by Ani et al. (2019) provides a comprehensive review of critical infrastructure protection
approaches. By analyzing different modeling landscapes, this research emphasizes the importance of
improving security through the responsiveness of cybersecurity measures. This approach can be applied
to the NBN to enhance its resilience against cyber threats and ensure its status as a cybersecure critical
infrastructure.

## Spatial Justice Implications and Social Potential

The implementation of the NBN has spatial justice implications, as highlighted by the research by
Alizadeh (2015). The rollout of high-speed broadband infrastructure can impact the socio-economic status
of different regions and communities. Understanding these implications is crucial for ensuring equitable
access to the NBN and addressing potential disparities in cybersecurity preparedness.
Additionally, the research by Dias (2012) focuses on the social potential of Australia's project for
universal broadband access. It emphasizes the need to go beyond technical aspects and consider the
social dimensions of the NBN. This research suggests that social factors should be incorporated into
cybersecurity strategies to ensure that the NBN benefits all segments of society.

## Metropolitan Planning and Local Government Initiatives

Spatial planning and metropolitan planning play a vital role in the deployment and management of the
NBN infrastructure. The research by Alizadeh et al. (2014) explores the relationship between the NBN
and metropolitan planning. It highlights the need for coordination between federally funded initiatives and
locally driven innovations. This coordination can facilitate the integration of cybersecurity considerations
into metropolitan planning processes.
Moreover, the research by Alizadeh and Shearer (2015) examines high-speed broadband responses at the
local government level in Australia. It provides insights into the role of local governments in the NBN
rollout and the potential for locally driven innovations to enhance cybersecurity measures. Collaborative

efforts between local governments and federal agencies can strengthen the cybersecurity of the NBN.

## Health Equity and Digital Infrastructure

The implementation of the NBN has implications for health equity, as discussed in the research by
Schram et al. (2018). The availability of digital infrastructure, such as high-speed broadband, can
impact health outcomes and contribute to health inequities. This research emphasizes the importance of
considering the role of digital infrastructure in achieving health equity and suggests integrating health
equity considerations into cybersecurity strategies for the NBN.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Australia's National Broadband Network is a critical infrastructure project that requires
robust cybersecurity measures to ensure its resilience against cyber threats. Addressing the cybersecurity
risks and challenges associated with the NBN requires a comprehensive approach that includes data
localization laws, the adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a human-centric approach, and
the development of effective cybersecurity laws and regulations. Moreover, considering the spatial justice
implications, incorporating social factors, and integrating cybersecurity into metropolitan planning and
local government initiatives can further enhance the cybersecurity of the NBN. Additionally, recognizing
the impact of digital infrastructure on health equity and integrating health equity considerations into
cybersecurity strategies is crucial. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of implemented cybersecurity measures in the NBN and exploring innovative approaches to address emerging
cyber threats in this critical infrastructure.
