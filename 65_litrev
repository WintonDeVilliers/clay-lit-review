# Literature Review: The Link Between Industry 4.0 and Lean Manufacturing

## Introduction

The operations function plays a crucial role in creating and delivering services and products [1]. Operations management involves making management decisions and designing systems to ensure effective
operations [1]. In recent years, the concept of Industry 4.0 has gained significant attention due to its
potential to transform manufacturing processes. Industry 4.0 refers to the integration of digital technologies and cyber-physical systems in manufacturing [2]. On the other hand, lean manufacturing focuses on
eliminating waste and improving efficiency in production processes [2]. This literature review aims to
explore the relationship between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing.

## Industry 4.0 Enables Lean Manufacturing

Research has shown that Industry 4.0 has the capability to implement lean manufacturing practices [2].
Sanders et al. (2016) argue that the research activities in the field of Industry 4.0 serve as enablers for lean
manufacturing [2]. By leveraging digital technologies and data-driven decision-making, Industry 4.0 can
optimize production processes and reduce waste, aligning with the principles of lean manufacturing [2].
Therefore, it can be concluded that Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing are closely linked, with Industry
4.0 serving as a facilitator for lean practices.

## Limited Studies on the Link between Industry 4.0 and Lean Manufacturing

Despite the potential link between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing, there have been few studies
specifically investigating this relationship [3]. Buer et al. (2018) highlight the need for more research in
this area and propose a research agenda to bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing
[3]. This indicates that there is still a knowledge gap regarding the specific mechanisms through which
Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing interact. Future research should focus on exploring the link between
these two concepts to gain a deeper understanding of their interdependencies.

## Concurrent Implementation of Lean Practices and Industry 4.0 Technologies

Tortorella and Fettermann (2018) suggest that the concurrent implementation of lean production practices
and Industry 4.0 technologies leads to larger performance improvements [4]. This finding reinforces
the idea that Industry 4.0 can enhance the effectiveness of lean manufacturing practices. By integrating
digital technologies such as IoT, AI, and data analytics with lean principles, companies can achieve
greater operational efficiency and improved performance outcomes [4]. This highlights the importance
of considering the simultaneous implementation of lean practices and Industry 4.0 technologies for

maximum benefits.

## Indirect Effects of Industry 4.0 on Sustainable Organizational Performance through Lean Manufacturing Practices

Kamble et al. (2019) emphasize that Industry 4.0 has direct and indirect effects on sustainable organizational performance (SOP) through lean manufacturing practices [5]. Lean manufacturing practices,
which focus on waste reduction and continuous improvement, can contribute to the sustainability of
organizations [5]. By implementing Industry 4.0 technologies, organizations can enhance their lean
practices, leading to improved SOP [5]. This suggests that Industry 4.0 can indirectly influence SOP
through its impact on lean manufacturing practices. Further research is needed to explore the specific
mechanisms through which Industry 4.0 affects SOP.

## Changing Operations Trade-Offs in the Era of Industry 4.0

Olsen and Tomlin (2019) highlight that Industry 4.0 has the potential to change the traditional trade-offs
among cost, flexibility, speed, and quality in goods-producing industries [6]. The integration of digital
technologies in manufacturing processes enables companies to achieve higher levels of customization
and flexibility without sacrificing cost-efficiency and speed [6]. This implies that Industry 4.0 can help
organizations strike a better balance between different operational objectives. Future research should
explore the specific trade-offs and benefits associated with the adoption of Industry 4.0 in different
industries.

## Lean-Digitized Manufacturing as a Viable Business Strategy in the Industry 4.0 Era

Ghobakhloo and Fathi (2019) propose that the development of a lean-digitized manufacturing system can
be a viable business strategy for corporate survivability in the Industry 4.0 era [7]. By combining the
principles of lean manufacturing with digital technologies, organizations can streamline their operations,
reduce waste, and improve productivity [7]. This suggests that lean-digitized manufacturing can help
companies adapt to the changing landscape of Industry 4.0 and remain competitive. Future research should
focus on identifying the specific practices and technologies that enable the successful implementation of
lean-digitized manufacturing.

## Conclusion and Future Research Directions

In conclusion, the literature reviewed indicates a strong link between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing.
Industry 4.0 has the potential to enable and enhance lean practices, leading to improved performance
outcomes and sustainable organizational performance. However, there is still a need for more research in
this area. Future studies should focus on exploring the specific mechanisms through which Industry 4.0
and lean manufacturing interact, as well as the trade-offs and benefits associated with their implementation. Additionally, further research is needed to investigate the impact of lean-digitized manufacturing

on corporate survivability in the Industry 4.0 era. By addressing these knowledge gaps, researchers can
contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing and
provide valuable insights for practitioners in the field of operations management.
