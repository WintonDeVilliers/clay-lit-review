Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to determine the opportunities and challenges that lead to
cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa by looking at the factors that
influence adoption. The TOE framework is used to contextualize the factors that
influence cloud computing adoption and evaluate the opportunities and challenges that
are presented by cloud computing to SMMEs in South Africa. An online survey
questionnaire was used to collect data from leaders of SMMEs from all geographical
regions and business industries in South Africa. A quantitative research approach was
adopted to investigate the objectives, and descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the
relationships and present the results. The findings of the study show that relative
advantage is an important factor in the consideration of cloud computing adoption by
SMMEs, while government and regulatory support is perceived as a barrier. Top
management support, which has been previously found by other studies to be a
significant factor has been found to be insignificant in this study. The study has revealed
that cloud computing presents opportunities to SMMEs and improves their
competitiveness.

1. INTRODUCTION
Small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) are critical to the success of the economies of many
countries around the world. They contribute to the creation of employment, the growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP), the development of professional skills and the reduction of poverty.
However, in South Africa SMMEs face many challenges that result in their failure or stagnation
which causes an increase in the unemployment rate, poverty and inequality. A 2018 report by the
Small Enterprises Development Agency (SEDA), an agency of the Department of Small Business
Development with a mandate to develop small businesses, shows a year-on-year decline in the
number of SMMEs in South Africa (Small Enterprises Development Agency, 2018). There are many
contributing factors to the failure of small businesses, including a lack of information and
communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, a lack of access to credit or financial support and
inadequate managerial and employee skills and knowledge, among other factors.
In South Africa, the definition of an SMME is provided in the National Small Business Act (Act
102 of 1996), which defines a small business as “a separate and distinct entity, including cooperative
enterprises and non-governmental organisations … which can be classified as a micro, a very small,
a small or a medium enterprise” (The DTI, 2003). The National Small Business Act classifies an
SMME by means of a matrix of business sector on the y-axis and size of full-time paid employees,
total annual turnover and total gross asset value on the x-axis. In the classification of a small
business, the number of employees is the same across all sectors: less than 5 for micro enterprises,
less than 10 for very small enterprises and less than 50 employees and less than 200 for mediumsize enterprises (except for the Agriculture sector where a medium-size enterprise has less than 100

employees). The values for total industry turnover differ according to sector. Stats SA, South
Africa’s national statistics agency, adjusts the total annual turnover cut off points for inflation to
classify enterprises (Small Enterprises Development Agency, 2018). Table 1 shows the cut-off
points – using the Rand currency – for enterprise turnover, as of December 2018.
SEDA (2018) segments SMMEs into either formal or informal. Enterprises operating in the formal
sector are registered with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), South
Africa’s companies’ registration agency, and submit their annual tax returns to the South African
Revenue Services (SARS); and SMMEs operating in the informal sector are not registered with the
CIPC and comprise largely a single worker who is the owner. According to SEDA’s SMME
Quarterly Update report (2018) for the 1st quarter of 2018, out of the 2 443 163 SMMEs in South
Africa, 73% are in the informal sector and 27% are in the formal sector.
The SMME sector is critical for the development of South Africa’s economy: alleviating poverty,
unemployment and inequality. The government’s National Development Plan (NDP) recognizes
that to achieve the objectives of the plan, among other initiatives, it needs to provide support for
small businesses by easing rules for and procuring from small businesses, as well as improve access
to finances for SMMEs (National Planning Commission, 2012). According to Stats SA’s Quarterly
Financial Statistics (QFS) for March 2018, SMMEs (excluding those with a turnover of less than
R2 million) contributed 35% of South Africa’s total turnover for the quarter (Statistics South Africa,
2018). And although the SMME Quarterly Update report (2018) indicates a 1.4% year-on-year
decline in the number of SMMEs and 15.9% year-on-year decrease in the number of jobs they
provide, this sector is still the larger provider of employment in the South African economy with the
8 886 015 jobs provided constituting around 55% of South Africa’s total workforce.
There is a small number of studies about cloud computing adoption by SMMEs (Kumar et al., 2017).
In South Africa, there exists limited research about the opportunities and challenges of cloud
computing adoption for SMMEs. Hinde & Belle (2012) recommended that a study with a more
representative and larger sample be conducted in future to enrich the knowledge of the benefits and
challenges of cloud computing for South African SMMEs. Kumalo & Poll (2015) recommend
further research on cloud computing to address the challenges experienced by SMMEs. This
research uses the TOE (technology-organisation-environment) framework to determine the
challenges and opportunities of cloud computing for SMMEs in South Africa. The seeks to find the
factors that represent opportunities and challenges of cloud computing adoption by the SMMEs.
Formal SMMEs were selected for participation in the study as they are more likely to know about
and use cloud computing and, due to the data collection method chosen, are more likely to be
reachable for participation. The goal of this paper is to provide leaders of SMMEs an empirical study
and resulting information about factors to take into consideration when making the decision whether
adopt cloud computing.

2. RELATED LITERATURE
This section discusses the definition of cloud computing, followed by the benefits and the
opportunities presented by cloud computing, then discusses the Technology, Organisation and
Environment (TOE) framework.
2.1 Definition of cloud computing
The concept of cloud computing has been in existence for some time. It started in the 1950s when
dumb terminals connected to and accessed a complex and expensive mainframe computer over a
network (Neto, 2014). The idea of cloud computing can be traced back to 1961 when Professor John
McCarthy, an American computer scientist at Stanford University who created the computer timesharing theory (McCarthy, 1983), said that “computing may someday be organised as a public utility
…” (Garfinkel, 2011). In 1966, DF Parkhill further explored the forms and models – virtualization
and grid computing – and benefits – latency of IT complexity and reduction in IT costs – of utility
computing (Parkhill, 1966). Between the 1970’s and the 1980’s, cloud computing as a concept was
advanced by the creation of the World Wide Web and the emergence of virtual machines (VMs) and
virtual private networks (VPNs) by telecommunications companies (Neto, 2014). Salesforce is
credited to be one of the first movers into cloud computing by delivering enterprise applications
over the Internet in 1999 (Tripathi & Jigeesh, 2013).
2.2 Benefits of cloud computing for SMMEs
Enterprises must adapt to the constantly changing business environment by using cutting-edge
technology that provide competitive advantage. Following are some of the main benefits that
SMMEs can derive from cloud computing.
Ease of management of IT systems. Depending on the service model – IaaS, PaaS or SaaS – cloud
computing reduces or eliminates the need for SMMEs to manage information technology systems.
On a SaaS subscription, the cloud customer is not concerned with how or where the software is run
and managed as those are hidden from them; the cloud service provider ensures that the software is
always available to the customer. Thus, companies do not rely on internal infrastructure and
footprint with regards to facilities (Vargas et al., 2017).
Reduction of IT costs. Cloud computing is cost-effective for SMMEs (Adane, 2018). Affordability
is the most attractive aspect of cloud computing for SMMEs, particularly in developing economies,
as found by a survey conducted by Rath et al. (2012).
Centralized working environment. Cloud computing provides a centralized platform for
development, testing, deployment, data storage and IT management for decentralized teams
(Bartoletti, 2017). This improves team collaboration and resource sharing and removes duplication
through integrated product teams that focus on creating customer-centric products. Korongo et al.
(2013) asserted that cloud computing enables collaboration between cross-functional teams through
resource sharing and increased usage of hardware, and that businesses can be conducted from any
geographical location and at any time.
Improve application delivery. Cloud computing provides access to advanced middleware and data
services that improve application delivery by increasing developer productivity and code quality
through the reduction of errors, testing costs and an increase in accuracy (Vargas et al., 2017).
Scalability. The scalability of computing resources is an important aspect of the cloud to businesses
(Tripathi & Jigeesh, 2013). Cloud computing allows an SMME to scale up and down according to
the computing requirements of the business and offers great opportunities to enable growth.
Proceedings of the 1st Virtual Conference on Implications of Information and Digital Technologies for Development, 2021

Improved security. Cloud computing removes the need for physical security required to protect IT
infrastructure (Lalev, 2017). AWS (2017), in asserting that it has comprehensive security
capabilities, explains six advantages of cloud security: 1) integration of compliance and security; 2)
economies of scale where all AWS customers benefit from security innovation and improvements;
3) customers don’t have to be concerned about managing security; 4) system configurations can be
infused with all security features; 5) information about security issues are included; and 6) and using
the cloud to protect the cloud service. Nedelcu et al. (2015) argue that although cloud computing
may not be ideal for storing highly sensitive data, it is safer than on-premises systems.
Improved performance and high availability. Cloud computing enables easy and convenient
anytime, anywhere access to data and applications using any type of device that has an internet
connection (Khan, 2014), and therefore is always available.
Competitiveness. Sheedy (2018) found that enterprises are using the public cloud to be more
competitive and rapidly create new customer value by leveraging the ecosystem of partners and
independent service providers (ISVs) in cloud computing.
2.3 Theoretical background for cloud computing adoption
There are several theories used in studying the determinants of the adoption of technology by
organisations: Technology Readiness (TR), Task-technology Fit (TTF), Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM), TAM2, TAM3, Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP), Decomposed Theory of
Planned Behaviour, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT), and
Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) and Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework (Lai,
2017; Tarhini et al., 2015). Lai reviewed the different technology adoption theories and concluded
that different models and theories can be used based on the research problem, variables and
measurement.
The DOI and the TOE models are the most popular theories is studying the factors that influence
the adoption of technology. Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) was developed by Everitt Rogers (2003)
to help the acceleration of the adoption and diffusion of new technological ideas through
communication over time to remove uncertainty about the innovation. Cloud computing has been
diffused and has been growing since the mid-2000s (Fabel, 2018). Low et al. (2011) found that
factors that affect the adoption of cloud computing can be explored using the TOE framework,
which, although different industries may show different determinant, covers all aspects of adoptions
issues.
2.4 The TOE Framework
The TOE framework has been used in many studies to determine the factors that influence the
adoption of cloud computing. Low et al., (2011) used the framework to examine eight factors that
determine the adoption of cloud computing: relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, top
management support, firm size, technology readiness, competitive pressure, and trading partner
pressure. Alshamaila et al. (2013) used TOE to study the cloud adoption process for SMEs in the
north east of England. Li et al. (2015) explained the drivers of cloud service transformation in SMEs
using the framework. Gangwar et al. (2015) integrated the TOE framework with the TAM
(technology acceptance model) to understand cloud computing adoption. And many more other
studies have been conducted using the TOE framework (Alshamaila et al., 2013).
3. RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT
This section proposes a research model based on the TOE framework and then presents the
developed hypotheses. The model includes the technological, organisational and environmental
contexts for factors that pose challenges and present opportunities of cloud computing for SMMEs.
Figure 1 depicts the model, derived from Low et al. (2011), with the TOE drivers that determine the
adoption of cloud computing.

4. DATA COLLECTION
Data was collected through an online survey questionnaire that comprised a formalized and
prespecified list of close-ended questions with the option of entering free-text in some questions
where the provided possible answers do not satisfy the survey participant. The questionnaire had
two sections: company profile information and questions to evaluate the factors that affect cloud
computing adoption. See appendix for the online survey questionnaire. The survey took was
designed and tested to take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
To ensure that the questionnaire measures the objectives of the research and that consistent
responses are obtained, the questionnaire was validated through face validity and content validity.
Face validity will be performed by having two professional cloud computing subject matter experts
who have before conducted research in any field read through the questionnaire to assess whether it
effectively measures the topic it is intended to investigate. This will help eliminate poor-quality
questions or add more relevant high-quality questions. Content validity was used determine whether
the content of the survey is consistent, and effectively and expansively measures what the research
purports to measure.
5. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The purpose of this study is to identify how cloud computing adoption can benefit small, medium
and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) in South Africa. A quantitative research approach was
adopted for this study to investigate the objectives.
5.1. Hypotheses of the study
Based on the conceptual model discussed in the literature review, there were ten hypothesis that
were evaluated for their relationship.

Table 7: Relationship between firm scope and challenges of cloud computing adoption
In summary, there is no relationship between the firm scope and the opportunities nor the challenges
to the adoption of cloud computing.
5.1.2. Continuous variables hypotheses
There were seven continuous variable which were formed in constructs and used to test the
relationship with opportunities and the challenges to the adoption of cloud computing. The
hypotheses were analysed using Pearson correlation where they are normally distributed or
Kendall’s tau b where they are non-normal.
5.1.2.1.Reliability and Normality of constructs
Table 8 presents the reliability and the normality of the constructs. Based on the guidelines of George
and Mallery, the reliability of compatibility and trading partner pressure were poor, and these were
not used further in the study, as such hypothesis 2 (compatibility) and hypothesis 10 (trading partner
pressure) could not be tested. The other constructs showed acceptable to excellent reliability as they
were all higher than 0.7. In addition, these constructs were also normally distributed as their
Skewness and Kurtosis were within the guidelines of ±2 by Hair et al (2010).

Table 12 presents the linear regression analysis for complexity and government regulatory support
as they had a significant relationship based on the results of Pearson correlation. The overall model
was significant, F = 14.901, p < .001, though the variance explained was low with R2 = 0.151
(15.1%). This low variance indicated that this model results must be treated with causing, even
though there was no multicollinearity (VIF ~1.00) and Durbin Watson for autocorrelation was 2.093,
showing not autocorrelation. Complexity (β =-0.351, p <0.01) contributed negatively to the variance
explained while government regulatory support (β =0.192, p <.01) contributed positive to the
challenges for the adoption of cloud computing.

Sithole & Ruhode Cloud Computing Adoption: Challenges and Opportunities for SMMEs
6. DISCUSSION
The study was conducted to test whether each variable in the hypotheses presented either an
opportunity and/or challenge of cloud computing adoption for SMMEs in South Africa.
6.1 Technological context
The strong positive relationship between relative advantage and opportunities of cloud computing
adoption is consistent with findings by Low et al., (2011), Alshamaila et al. (2013), (Oliveira &
Martins, 2011), Kumar et al. (2017). A study by Senyo et al. (2016) for cloud computing adoption
in a developing country (like South Africa) also found the relationship to be significant, but, contrary
to the finding of this study, with a negative relation. Consistently, there is no significance for the
relationship between relative advantage and challenges of cloud computing adoption, which leads
to the conclusion that relative advantage, which represents benefits and opportunities such cost
reduction, competitiveness, scalability, etc. of cloud computing, has a strong significance in
influencing cloud computing adoption for SMMEs in South Africa.
The positive significance of the relationship between complexity and opportunities and the negative
significant of the relationship between complexity and challenges indicate that complexity is a factor
in cloud computing adoption. The result of complexity having a negative significance on cloud
computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa is consistent with Louw et al. (2011) and conflicting
with studies by Oliveira & Martins (2011) and Gutierrez, Boukrami, & Lumsden (2015) who found
complexity to be a barrier. The possible reason the SMMEs that participated in this study do not
link cloud computing with complexity is because cloud computing is deemed to be easy to use and
it simplifies IT systems management and application development and delivery. The cloud
compatibility variable was not tested on the results of the study as they were found to have poor
reliability.
6.2 Organisational context
The study found top management support to be insignificant to either opportunities and challenges
of cloud computing by SMMEs in South Africa. While Gutierrez et al. (2015) congruently found
top management support to not be a driver of cloud computing adopiton, the finding of this study is
inconsistent with other previous studies (Low et al., 2011; Alshamaila et al., 2013; Senyo et al.,
2016; AL-Shboul, 2018). This study viewed top management support from only a financial support
perspective while knowledge and skill was assessed from the perspective of the enterprise
compatibility. This could be reason for the finding being inconsistent with earlier studies.
Firm size was found to not have any significance on opportunities and challenges of cloud
computing adoption, consistent with Senyo et al. (2016) and AL-Shboul (2018) and inconsistent
with Low et al. (2011). Out of the 174 study participants, only 3.4% firms had more than 200
employees and 8% had between 100 and 199 employees. 88.6% of the participants are small, which
could explain why firm size had no significance in the study. Firm scope showed a weak positive
significance with the opportunities of cloud computing adoption, contrasting findings by Senyo et
al. (2016). This indicates that the wider the geographical scope of an SMME, the more likely it is
adopt cloud computing as it is seen as an opportunity to reach more customers, centralize IT systems
and improve collaboration among other benefits.
The study also found technology readiness to have a weak positive significance with the
opportunities of cloud computing adoption. This finding is consistent with Oliveira and Martins
(2010), Zhu et al. (2003), Senyo et al. (2016), while being inconsistent with Louw et al. (2011) who
unexpectedly found this factor to be insignificant. Technology readiness refers to the readiness of
the people in the organisation and the required infrastructure to adopt cloud computing. This study
shows that the SMMEs have the required capabilities to adopt cloud computing.

6.3 Environmental context
The study found competitive pressure to have a positive significance on the opportunities of cloud
computing adoption, consistent with studies by Louw et al. (2011) and Senyo et al. (2016). This
finding could be attributable to the fact that SMMEs want to be competitive through the attraction
of new customers and retention of existing customers by improving service levels and customer
experience. Also, if SMMEs think or know that their competitors are adopting cloud computing in
order to derive the advantages it offers, they are more likely to adopt the same technology. In the
study competitive pressure was not seen by SMMEs as a challenge to cloud computing adoption.

Sithole & Ruhode Cloud Computing Adoption: Challenges and Opportunities for SMMEs
Government and regulatory support had showed a weak positive significance on the challenges and
no significance on the opportunities of cloud computing adoption by South African SMMEs,
according to the study, meaning that government and regulatory support is perceived negatively.
This is consistent with Zhu et al. (2003) and AL-Shbou (2018) who also found regulatory support
to have significance. However, it is incongruent with Senyo et al. (2016) who found that this factor
had no significant. In South Africa, this could be due to the fact that government is perceived to not
be supportive to the success of SMMEs in regard to technology. Regulations, such as affirmative
action and labour laws, are generally perceived to be barriers to the success of SMMEs because they
make it hard to easily hire and fire, in the case of labour laws, and for SMMEs get certain work
contracts, in the case of affirmative action.
7. CONCLUSION
This study sought to investigate the factors that factors that represent opportunities and challenges
of cloud computing adoption by the SMMEs. A literature review on cloud computing to provide a
definition, benefit and opportunities and challenges of cloud computing and on the theoretical
framework, the TOE framework, was performed to contextualize the factors that impact cloud
computing adoption opportunities and challenges. The factors of the TOE framework was used to
develop the research model and formulate 10 hypotheses that postulated the relationship between
each of the factors and the opportunities and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in
South Africa: relationship between relative advantage and opportunities and challenges of cloud
computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa; relationship between complexity and opportunities
and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa; relationship between top
management support and opportunities and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in
South Africa; relationship between firm size support and opportunities and challenges of cloud
computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa; relationship between firm scope and opportunities
and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa; relationship technology
readiness and opportunities and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in South
Africa; relationship between competitive pressure and opportunities and challenges of cloud
computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa; and relationship between government and
regulatory support and opportunities and challenges of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in
South Africa.
The results of the study found six factors to have significance on the opportunities and challenges
of cloud computing adoption by SMMEs in South Africa: relative advantage, complexity,
technology readiness, firm scope, competitive pressure and government support. Relative advantage,
firm scope, technology readiness and competitive pressure were found to favourably represent
opportunities of cloud computing adoption, while government support was found to present a
challenge for cloud computing adoption. The complexity of cloud computing was significant as both
an opportunity and a challenge; however, negatively as a challenge and positively as an opportunity,
indicating that SMMEs did not find complexity as a problem for cloud computing adoption. Two
variables – top management support and firm size – were found to be in insignificant. SMMEs
consider relative advantage – the benefits and opportunities – to be a strong significant factor for
cloud computing adoption.
