# Literature Review: Cyber Security of Small-to-Medium Businesses

## Introduction

Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) play a significant role in many economies, yet they are often
lacking in implementing adequate cyber security measures, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
Despite this, the research in cyber security has primarily focused on larger enterprises, neglecting the
specific needs and challenges faced by SMBs. This literature review aims to explore the existing research
on the cyber security of SMBs, highlighting the challenges they face, identifying the research focus areas,
and providing recommendations for improving their cyber security posture.

## Research Gap: Neglect of SMBs in Cyber Security Research

One prominent research gap in the field of cyber security is the lack of focus on SMBs, despite their
representation of a significant proportion of businesses. Chidukwani, Zander, and Koutsakis (2022)
highlight this gap in their survey, stating that the research in cyber security rarely addresses the specific
needs and challenges faced by SMBs. This neglect of SMBs in research hinders the development of
tailored and effective cyber security strategies for this critical sector.

## Challenges in Cyber Security for SMBs

Several challenges contribute to the inadequate implementation of cyber security measures in SMBs.
Chidukwani et al. (2022) identify the following challenges:

1. Limited Resources: SMBs often have limited financial and human resources dedicated to cyber security,
   making it difficult to adopt comprehensive security measures.
2. Lack of Awareness: Many SMBs lack awareness about the importance of cyber security and the potential
   risks they face. This leads to a lack of proactive measures and a reactive approach to cyber threats.
3. Technical Complexity: Cyber security technologies and solutions can be complex and require specialized knowledge to implement and manage. SMBs may lack the necessary technical expertise to effectively
   utilize these tools.
4. Third-Party Dependencies: SMBs often rely on third-party vendors and service providers for various
   aspects of their operations. This introduces additional security risks, as the security practices of these
   external entities may not align with the SMBs' requirements.
5. Compliance Challenges: SMBs may struggle to comply with regulatory and industry-specific security
   standards due to limited resources and expertise.

## Research Focus Areas

While research on the cyber security of SMBs is limited, there are several key focus areas that have been
identified. Chidukwani et al. (2022) present the following research focus areas:

1. Risk Assessment and Management: Understanding the specific cyber security risks faced by SMBs and
   developing effective risk assessment and management frameworks tailored to their needs.
2. Security Awareness and Training: Investigating approaches to enhance security awareness among SMBs
   and providing targeted training programs to improve their cyber security knowledge and practices.
3. Cost-Effective Solutions: Developing cost-effective cyber security solutions that address the resource
   constraints faced by SMBs, enabling them to implement robust security measures within their budgetary
   limitations.
4. Third-Party Risk Management: Exploring strategies for managing the security risks associated with
   third-party dependencies, such as vetting vendors, establishing contractual requirements, and conducting
   regular security audits.
5. Regulatory Compliance Support: Investigating ways to assist SMBs in complying with relevant
   security regulations and industry standards, considering their resource limitations and specific compliance
   challenges.

## Recommendations for Improving Cyber Security in SMBs

Based on the challenges and research focus areas identified, several recommendations can be made to
improve the cyber security posture of SMBs:

1. Increased Research Focus: Researchers and policymakers should allocate more resources and attention
   to studying the cyber security needs and challenges faced by SMBs. This can help develop targeted
   solutions and strategies that cater to their unique requirements.
2. Awareness Campaigns: Initiating awareness campaigns to educate SMBs about the importance of cyber
   security and the potential threats they face. These campaigns should emphasize the potential impact of
   cyber-attacks on their business operations and reputation.
3. Training and Skill Development: Providing accessible and affordable training programs specifically
   designed for SMBs to enhance their cyber security knowledge and skills. These programs should cover
   essential topics such as threat awareness, secure practices, and incident response.
4. Collaboration with Industry Associations: Collaborating with industry associations and trade groups to
   disseminate best practices and guidelines for cyber security in SMBs. This can help SMBs leverage the
   collective knowledge and experience of their peers.
5. Tailored Solutions: Encouraging the development of cost-effective cyber security solutions tailored to
   the needs and resource limitations of SMBs. These solutions should prioritize ease of use, automation,
   and affordability.

6. Regulatory Support: Governments and regulatory bodies should consider providing additional support
   to SMBs in complying with security regulations and industry standards. This can include simplified
   compliance frameworks, educational resources, and financial incentives.

## Conclusion

The cyber security of SMBs is a critical area that has been largely neglected in research, despite their
significant representation in the business landscape. This literature review highlights the challenges faced
by SMBs in implementing cyber security measures and identifies key research focus areas. By addressing
these challenges and conducting further research, policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders
can work together to develop effective strategies and solutions that enhance the cyber security posture
of SMBs, ultimately protecting them from cyber threats and contributing to a more secure business
ecosystem.
