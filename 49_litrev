# Literature Review: Cyber Risk Frequency, Severity and Insurance Viability

## Introduction

The cyber insurance industry has gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing
frequency and severity of cyber loss events. As organizations become more reliant on technology and
digital assets, the potential financial impact of cyber threats has become a concern for both businesses and
insurers. In order to effectively transfer cyber risk through insurance policies, it is crucial to understand
the factors that contribute to the frequency and severity of cyber loss events, as well as their heterogeneity
across different cyber risk categories. Furthermore, it is important to assess the viability of cyber insurance
in terms of required premiums and risk pool sizes. This literature review aims to explore the existing
research findings on these topics and highlight potential knowledge gaps for future research.

## Factors influencing the frequency and severity of cyber loss events

Understanding the factors that contribute to the frequency and severity of cyber loss events is essential
for insurers to accurately assess and price cyber risk. However, the existing research does not provide
a clear answer to this question, as stated in the abstract. Khalili et al. (2018) propose that the design of
cyber insurance policies should consider pre-screening and security interdependence. By identifying and
evaluating the security measures implemented by insured organizations, insurers can better assess the
likelihood and impact of cyber threats. This suggests that the level of security measures implemented by
organizations may be a significant covariate in explaining the frequency and severity of cyber loss events.

## Heterogeneity of factors across cyber risk categories

To effectively manage cyber risk, it is important to understand whether the factors influencing the
frequency and severity of cyber loss events are heterogeneous across different cyber risk categories.
Unfortunately, the provided research findings do not directly address this question. However, by utilizing
a conceptual cyber risk classification and assessment framework, it is possible to quantify the risk of cyber
threats and evaluate the effectiveness of control barriers (Nshakira-Rukundo et al., 2019). This framework
combines a bow-tie model with a risk matrix to rate the likelihood and severity of cyber threats. By
applying this framework to different cyber risk categories, it may be possible to identify variations in the
factors influencing the frequency and severity of cyber loss events.

## Viability of cyber risk insurance

Assessing the viability of cyber insurance requires considering the required premiums and risk pool sizes.
However, the provided research findings do not directly address this aspect of the research question.

Nevertheless, by understanding the factors influencing the frequency and severity of cyber loss events,
insurers can better estimate the potential financial impact of cyber threats and determine appropriate
premium levels. Additionally, by quantifying the risk of cyber threats using a classification and assessment
framework, insurers can identify areas of concern and evaluate the effectiveness of control barriers. This
information can help insurers assess the viability of cyber insurance by considering the potential loss
exposure and the ability of the risk pool to cover such losses.

## Knowledge gaps and future research directions

While the provided research findings contribute valuable insights to the understanding of cyber risk
frequency, severity, and insurance viability, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in
future research. Firstly, there is a need for further research to identify the specific factors that are most
significant in explaining the frequency and severity of cyber loss events. This could involve analyzing a
larger dataset of cyber events and conducting statistical analyses to determine the covariates that have the
strongest relationship with cyber risk. Additionally, future research should explore the heterogeneity of
these factors across different cyber risk categories, as this can provide more targeted risk management
strategies for specific industries or sectors.
Furthermore, future research should focus on conducting empirical studies to assess the viability of cyber
insurance in terms of required premiums and risk pool sizes. This can involve analyzing historical data on
cyber loss events and calculating the potential financial impact on insured organizations. By comparing
this impact with the premiums collected and the size of the risk pool, researchers can determine whether
cyber insurance is financially sustainable and whether adjustments need to be made to ensure its viability.
In conclusion, the literature on cyber risk frequency, severity, and insurance viability provides some
insights into the factors that influence these aspects of cyber risk. However, further research is needed
to fill the knowledge gaps and provide a more comprehensive understanding of cyber insurance. By
addressing these gaps, insurers can make more informed decisions regarding the underwriting and pricing
of cyber insurance policies, ultimately enhancing the resilience of businesses against cyber threats.
