Cybercrime is touted as any harmful behaviour that is in some way related to a computer but does not
have a specific legal reference. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore cybersecurity as a
response to combating cybercrime, focusing on demystifying the prevailing threats, while offering
recommendations to the African regions. Moreover, this qualitative study employed a non-empirical
research design: Systematic review methodology to analyse grey literature and primary research
studies peer-reviewed and published, restricted from 2010-2022, not following yearly sequential
consideration. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
and Critical Appraisal Skill Programme (CASP) were employed to ensure the trustworthiness of the
findings of this study based on reviewed conventional and seminal literature studies on this subject.
The main findings of this study rest on a lack of a common universal definition of cybercrime, this has
an impact on its prevention and ignores enormous economic value associated with the commission of
this crime across the world, African regions included. It was also observed that this criminal act is
presently committed with internet usage, consisting of copyright infringements, computer-related
fraud, child or adult pornography, and network security violations, amongst others. Equally,
addressing this scourge in African regions requires advanced skills and knowledge; exceeding the
average computer and internet user. It is also critical to recognise the importance of implementing
efficient cybersecurity methods, as policing this crime remains an important component of the Law
Enforcement Agencies (LEA), and more innovative strategies are required and a globally coordinated
response to this problem is urgently sought.

Introduction
As human behaviour and interaction continue to be shaped by increasingly ubiquitous technologies, organisations must continuously
adapt their capabilities to deal with and prevent malicious actors from taking advantage of the shifting technological landscape.
Cybersecurity must be prioritised in all domains of society and the economy if we are to unlock the true potential of the digital
economy. Cybersecurity is not a separate technology but rather a foundational set of systems spanning technology, people and
processes for the Fourth Industrial Revolution [4IR], Jurgens (2022). World Economic Forum (2022) highlights that digital trends
and their exponential proliferation due to the Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic have thrust the global population onto
a new trajectory of digitalisation and interconnectedness. One of the starkest and most troubling new consequences of our digitalised
existence is the increasingly frequent, costly and damaging occurrence of cyber incidents, sometimes even paralysing critical services

and infrastructure. This trend shows no signs of slowing, notably as sophisticated tools and methods become more widely available
to threat actors at relatively low (Or in some cases no) cost.
Cybercrime is crime committed via the Internet and computer systems. One category of cybercrimes are those affecting the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and computer systems; they include: unauthorised access to computer systems, illegal
interception of data transmissions, data interference (Damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration of suppression of data), system
interference (The hindering without right of the functioning of a computer or other device), forgery, fraud, identity theft. Other types
of cybercrimes are content-related, and involve the production, offering, distribution, procurement and possession of online content
deemed as illegal according to national laws: online child sexual abuse material, material advocating a terrorist-related act, extremist
material (Material encouraging hate, violence or acts of terrorism), cyber-bullying (Engaging in offensive, menacing or harassing
behaviour through the use of technology). Cybercrime is part of a broader cybersecurity approach, and is aimed at ensuring Internet
safety and security (Geneva Internet Platform, 2022).
Moreover, Malby, Mace, Holterhof, Brown, Kascherus and Ignatuschtschenko (2013) share that cybercrime includes all illegal acts
committed through electronic use. It therefore requires electronic operations that are aimed at cracking the security of a computer
system and compromising the data processed by the computer. In the commission of such crimes, the Internet plays a vital role. Saini,
Rao and Panda (2012) define the Internet as “a collection of millions of computers [With] a network of electronic connections
between computers.” Based on the United Nations (UN) definition of cybercrime, it may be asserted that the scope of cybercrime
goes way beyond the many well-known scams that are committed via emails, such as the infamous ‘Nigerian 419’ scam. Therefore,
cybercrime, in addition to email scams, includes a host of other illegal operations that make use of ultra-sophisticated technological
means (Fassassi & Akoussan, 2016). To understand and define cybercrime, Wall (2007) argues that it is crucial to explore the
contribution that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) make to global society and how they have transformed the
world. Cybercrime is commonly understood as a “harmful behaviour that is somehow related to a computer, however, it has no
specific reference in existing laws (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat & Hosseinian-Far, 2014). McGuire and Dowling (2013) concur that
cybercrime is a criminal offence that is committed by using a computer, computer networks, or any other form of ICT. Saini, Rao
and Panda’s (2012:202) definition is more incisive as they define cybercrime as “an act committed or omitted in violation of a law
forbidding or commanding it and for which punishment is imposed upon conviction”. In legal terms, this means that a cybercrime
must be legally determined and must be punishable by a conviction or fine.
According to the Bunga (2019), the ‘Convention on Cybercrime’ states that such criminal acts are committed over the Internet and
other computer networks and tend to focus on copyright infringements, computer-related fraud, child or adult pornography, and
network security violations. According to the Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention (2019), cybercrime offences range from
illegal activities to gain data access to content and copyright infringements. Jenalda and Kurebwa (2020) argue that the most
commonly used definition of cybercrime is that it is “any crime committed using computers, computer networks, or hardware
devices.” While applying the works of LEA in the African regions, the lack of a clear and universal definition of the cybercrime
phenomenon is problematic as it affects prevention measures. Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, and Hosseinian-Far (2014) confirm that
individuals, businesses and even governments have been victims of cybercrime. Contrary to traditional crimes that are committed in
identifiable geographical areas, cybercrime is committed through cyberspace and the perpetrators are thus ‘faceless’ and difficult to
trace. The latter scholars thus suggest that a “coordinated global response to the problem of cybercrime is required.” This implies
that international collaboration and the provision of cybersecurity are pivotal in addressing and eradicating this crime as it can be
generally committed across National borders.
The global economic environment is ever changing and has become highly dependent on the use of the Internet and electronic devices.
This is a vast shift from the pre twenty-first century era when economic and industrial growth was largely dependent on physical
labour. Moreover, driving this major shift in economic activity does not require sophisticated offices or a vast labour force. In fact,
our digital economy requires only sophisticated electronic systems, but ironically modern economic growth is threatened by
cybercrime and it has become crucial to safeguard global economies by preventing and eradicating this devastating form of crime
that has become increasingly threatening and invasive. For instance, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) recently reported that
there are in the region of 400 million victims of cybercrime annually (Ogwueleka & Aniche, 2021).
Globally, cybercrime has cost the economy between $300 billion and $1 trillion, or 0.4 to 1.4 percent of the global Gross Domestic
Product [GDP] (Farahbod, Shayo, & Varzandeh, 2020). Morgan (2020) postulates that, globally, financial losses due cybercrime are
expected to increase by 15% each year over the next five years. At this rate, it will hit an annual loss rate of $10.5 trillion by 2025
[R161 151 900 000 000,00], which will be an increase from $3 trillion [R46 047 000 000 000,01] in 2015. According to Bloomberg
(Ransomware, 2021, June), in 2020 cyberattacks amounted to global losses in excess of $1000 billion [R15 349 000 000 000,00] in
2020, while in that year ransom demands (I.e. Ransomware) had escalated by 40% and malicious Internet infiltration by more than
600% since 2019. These rates are extremely worrisome if one considers that they occurred in a matter of 12 months only.
Kshetri (2019) argues that internet infiltration has already reached an unacceptably high level in many African economies. Economic
losses due to cybercrime represent the most significant transfer of economic resources in history. This crime jeopardises incentives
for innovation and investment and the financial losses that it causes are much greater than the cost of natural disasters in a single year
(Morgan, 2020). Moreover, the African economy's growing exposure to cybercrime is a cause for concern, as developing countries 
Mphatheni and Maluleke, International Journal of Research in Business & Social Science 11(4) (2022), 384-396
386
on this continent are increasingly reliant on networked computer systems (Peter, 2017). African countries also often lack the
infrastructure to counteract sophisticated cyberattacks. On this continent economic activities utilising digital technology range from
data processing to a vast mosaic of social and economic activities, including millions of daily online banking transactions,
communications, smartphone downloads of Television (TV) shows and music albums, as well as initiatives like electronicgovernment (e-government) -e-banking-e-health-e-learning, next-generation power grids, air traffic control and other services (Peter,
2017:50).
The majority of African countries have now begun to capitalise on the economic and social potential of the Internet while a few
African countries are utilising the Internet even more extensively, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia,
Egypt, Libya, and Sudan (Peter, 2017). Unfortunately, this reliance on networked computer systems is exposed to unprecedented
vulnerabilities and many avenues for exploiting these weaknesses have been opened. At least five of Africa's top emerging economies
are among the top 30 countries globally in which Internet penetration has caused devastating effects (Peter, 2017). What exacerbates
this problem is that countries on this continent relies extensively on mobile banking services with the number of mobile subscribers
steadily increasing (Museba, Ranganai & Gianfrate, 2021). According to Nwankwo and Ukaoha (2019), cyberspace applications
have considerably affected and reformed various sectors on the African continent such as education, trade and commerce,
manufacturing and production, banking and finance, agriculture, public service, LEA, and crime control. They have also affected the
administration of justice, politics and governance, healthcare delivery, social relations, and media and communication.
Methodologically, this study adopted the non-empirical research design: Systematic review. Dan (2017) states that this research
design is adopted to review progress in a specific study field [Cybersecurity as a response to combating cybercrime: Demystifying
the prevailing threats and offering recommendations to the African regions]. This research design was employed to identify, evaluate
and summarise the findings of this study, focusing on reviewed literature studies to making available evidence more accessible to
decision-makers, by offering recommendations (Yannascoli, Schenker & Baldwin, 2013) and Bwanga (2020). To develop
understanding and obtaining the relevant information on this subject, the collected data stemmed from relevant databases, such as
‘Google, Google Scholar, EbcoHost, Emerald Insight, Jstor, Internet sources, ProQuest, Sabinet, Sage Online and Science Direct,’
were visited (Maluleke, 2020), this was done following a set of predetermined steps of this research design. The selective keywords
retrieved from the research topic were used to obtain relevant information on this subject, using non-probability: Purposefully
sampling. The reviewed data were restricted to 2010-2022, not in order of importance and sequence. This was done exercising the
exclusion and inclusion criterias of the required data. The PRISMA and CASP were employed to ensure trustworthiness of findings
of this study relating to the emergence highlights the trends, strategies and associated challenges of policing cybercrime in Africa.
Despite the enormous benefits of digital services for internet users worldwide, global cyberspace exploitation by miscreants and
criminals whose activities on the Internet and whose impact on computer resources have focused on wreaking havoc among legitimate
consumers of such resources, has had a significantly adverse effect on the economy. Extensive and advanced cybersecurity has thus
become a crucial requirement for safeguarding the global economy and governmental operations in order to ensure peace and security
in all spheres of life (Nwankwo & Ukaoha, 2019). The application of technical solutions to combat cybercrime has always been the
preferred option for most cybersecurity experts. However, most LEA in the African regions are not equipped with the requisite
technological knowledge while most cybercriminals are experts in computer technology. Therefore, the premise of this study rests
on cybersecurity as a response to combating cybercrime, to demystify the prevailing threats, while offering recommendations to the
African regions.
Literature Review
This section provided synthesis of relevant literature in a manner, which demonstrated that the researchers were familiar with the key
authors, texts and, central concepts relevant to this subject. The researchers showed how this study can contributes to what is already
known, to fill the niche/gap identified in the introduction section, focusing on situating this study within the academic domain and
substantiating the objective of this study as stipulated in the abstract section. The reviewed literature studies was deemed tom be
adequate, demarcated sources from 2010-2022, not in sequence, moreover sources of high academic standing, offering integrated
ideas, not separate writings on this topic [Cybersecurity as a response to combating cybercrime: Demystifying prevailing threats and
offering recommendations to the African regions] were consulted.
Cybercrime and cybercriminals: Cybersecurity induction
hile many factors are driving cybersecurity policies forward, we identified through our survey that 81% of respondents believe that
digital transformation is the main driver in improving cyber resilience. The accelerating pace of digitalisation due to the Covid-19
pandemic and the shift of our working habits is pushing cyber resilience forward. As many as 87% of executives are planning to
improve cyber resilience at their organisation by strengthening resilience policies, processes and standards for how to engage and
manage third parties, World Economic Forum (2022). The term cybercrime refers to several concepts that vary in specificity and
impact. Some of these include illegal activities resulting in pecuniary losses while others include violent crimes against individuals
or their property such as identity theft and blackmail (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, & Hosseinian-Far, 2014). Similar to traditional crimes,
the commission of cybercrime relies on the crime triangle (Cross & Shinder, 2008), which constitutes Three (03) factors: 1) A victim,
2) A motive, and; 3) An opportunity. 
Mphatheni and Maluleke, International Journal of Research in Business & Social Science 11(4) (2022), 384-396
387
The victim is the intended and/or actual victim of an attack (Physically or digitally), motive is what motivates the criminal to carry
out the attack, and opportunity is what makes the commission of the intended crime possible (Lallie, Shepherd, Nurse, Erola,
Epiphaniou, Maple, & Bellekens, 2021). However, cybercrime differs from other crimes in that they are physically non-violent as
digital devices are used for outcomes resulting in pecuniary loss. However, the emotional and mental harm that cybercrime causes
may be just as devastating and traumatising as the outcome of any physical crime. The ever-emerging new features that occur in
cyberspace create ever-evolving opportunities for digital crimes. Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, and Hosseinian-Far (2014:149) view these
new features as “key transformative opportunities.” They refer more specifically to the following:
i. Globalisation (Provides offenders with new opportunities to exceed conventional boundaries).
ii. Distribution networks (Generate new opportunities for victimisation).
iii. Synoptics and panopticism (Allow improved surveillance capability to target victims remotely).
iv. Data trails (Create easily accessible opportunities for criminals to commit identity theft).
Saini, Rao and Panda (2012) list perpetrators of this crime, such as crackers, hackers, pranksters, career criminals, cyber terrorists,
cyber bullies, and ‘salami attackers’ who are cybercriminals that target various stakeholders who then become the victims of
cybercrime. Criminality that occurs in cyberspace is known as cybercrime (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat & Hosseinian-Far, 2014).
Unfortunately, the escalation of such crimes seems unstoppable, as measures to curb them have not been adequate or efficient. It has
thus become a matter of urgency to devise effective preventative measures to curtail cybercrime by means of effective cybersecurity
(Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, & Hosseinian-Far, 2014). To devise cyberspace security measures requires in-depth understanding of the
nature and modus operandi of cybercriminals to expose their motives and operational methodologies. It is also important to
understand whom the victims of cyberspace crimes are as it is important to understand how and why these individuals, businesses,
and structures fall victim to such crimes. In essence, knowledge is power and this power should be used to create effective cyberspace
security measures (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat & Hosseinian-Far, 2014) to counteract the almost unlimited power that cybercriminals
have claimed for themselves.
The execution of a cybercrime requires someone who possesses skills and knowledge that exceed those of the average computer and
internet user (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat & Hosseinian-Far, 2014). Unlike traditional crimes that occur in a particular physical space,
cybercrime occurs in the intangibility of cyberspace where perpetrators can remain invisible and are often impossible to trace. The
cybercriminal thus feels invincible and devises cyberattacks that are increasingly sophisticated, while it has become increasingly
difficult to expose such criminals. Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, and Hosseinian-Far (2014) argue that, with limited understanding of
cybercriminals’ whereabouts and modus operandi, it is challenging the existing LEA to address cybercrime effectively. The use of a
computer or other similar technological devices, for example; a cellphone or tablet, to name the Two (02), play pivotal roles in the
commission of cybercrime (Du Toit, Hadebe & Mphatheni, 2018). A website may even become a victim of cybercrime when access
is denied to the legitimate user and when it is hacked and becomes compromised. The vehicle that hackers use is the computer and
the victims are either individuals, companies, or even governmental institutions. However, if the computer plays such a significant
role in the commission of cybercrime, it may also serve as a buffer between the offender and the victim if effective measures are built
into its operating system to detect potential hacking or intrusion (Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat & Hosseinian-Far, 2014).
Forms of cybercrime and their characteristics
Cybercrime is escalating in Africa where it poses a challenge to the economic and social development of countries. Cybercrime,
cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and cyber warfare are all new types of cybercrime that pose a threat to African countries while
ruthless cyber criminals such as hackers use cyber vulnerabilities to penetrate and destroy critical systems for financial gain or to
hold users hostage (Peter, 2017). The 2020 ransomware attack in which an oil company in the United States of America (USA) was
held hostage for a huge sum of money is a case in point (Cyberattack forces a shutdown of a top USA pipeline, 2020). To this course,
Council of Europe [CoE] (2001) lists the following several cybercrime offences:
i. Intentional access without the right to the whole or part of any computer system.
ii. Intentional interception, without right, of non-public transmissions of computer data.
iii. Intentional damage, deletions, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of computer data without right, amongst others.
iv. Intentional and serious hindering of the function of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting,
deteriorating, altering, or suppressing computer data.
v. The production, sale, procurement for use, importation, or distribution of devices designed to commit any of the above
crimes, or [I.e. Obtaining] passwords or similar data used to access computer systems, with the intent of committing
any of the above crimes.
Considerably, table 1 summarises various cybercrime-related offences [This list inexhaustible].

Furthermore, Jahankhani, Al-Nemrat, and Hosseinian-Far (2014:155) cite four cybercrime categories that are listed by Yar (2006):
i. Cyber trespassing: The crossing of cyber boundaries into other people’s computer systems to access spaces, where the
right of ownership or title has already been established in order to cause damage, for example; hacking or virus
distribution.
ii. Cyber deception and theft: These inflict different types of acquisitive harm in cyberspace. At one level are the more
traditional patterns of theft such as the fraudulent use of credit cards and (I.e. Cyber) cash, but it is also concerning that
there is an increasing potential for the raiding of online bank accounts as e-banking becomes more popular.
iii. Cyber pornography: The breaching of laws that address obscenity and indecency.
iv. Cyber violence: The violent impact of cyber activities on individuals, society, and political groupings or structures is
concerning. While such activities may not necessarily result in direct manifestations of a violent attack, the victim will
nevertheless experience violence and can bear long-term emotional and psychological scars as a consequence. These
activities range from cyber-stalking and hate speech to tech-talk.
Cybercrime activities such as phishing, spamming, hacking, cyber harassment, identity theft, credit/cheque card fraud and Internet
auction fraud have been extended to include the spreading of viruses and other malware (McGuire & Dowling, 2013). The identity
theft is one of the most worrying forms of cybercrime. Several factors contribute to identity theft such as “Subscriber Identity Module
or Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) swap fraud, a strong infrastructure of money wiring services, readily available Internet,
prepaid cell phones, high levels of corruption in many companies and government agencies, and a lack of police resources/expertise
to combat [I.e. These types] of crime” (South Africa, 2020). Identity theft is a skill that cybercriminals have mastered. For instance,
in some cases the attacker can increase the hacked user's access within a system, which results in extended identity fraud, theft, and
illegal access to sensitive data. Moreover, the integration of computing and communication capabilities within the power grid has
resulted in numerous cyber-physical system vulnerabilities (Sun, Hahn & Liu, 2018).
The nature and extent of cybercrime and cybersecurity in Africa
All countries on all continents are affected by cybercrime. A significant number of infected electronics involving malware have been
found in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Brazil, Algeria, and Mexico (Ogwueleka & Aniche, 2021). Cybercrime does not only affect
governments and organisations, but individuals as well. According to estimates by Microsoft (2014), about half of all adults who use
the Internet have been cybercrime victims. With reference to data provided by a British consulting firm, Kshetri (2019) estimates
that about a billion people in Africa will have access to the Internet by 2022. It is also proposed that the increase in Internet access
in Africa will be accompanied by various advantages and challenges as it will mean higher exposure to and a more significant number
of people with Internet connectivity in Africa. One danger is that Africans will be exposed to the increased risk of becoming victims
of cybercrime. Kshetri (2019) postulates that, by 2022, the projected billions of people in Africa with Internet access will not all be
law-abiding citizens and that a significant number of these people will be opportunistic criminals. This threat has already reared its 
Mphatheni and Maluleke, International Journal of Research in Business & Social Science 11(4) (2022), 384-396
389
ugly head in Ghana where financial institutions experienced over 400 000 malware-related attacks, 44 million spam-related cases,
and 280 000 botnet-related cases (Business Ghana, 2018). In 2013, Symantec observed that cybercrime in Africa was increasing
more rapidly compared than in the rest of the world (Kshetri, 2019), while in 2016 it discovered that 24 million malware cases had
already been experienced on this continent. These numbers undeniably suggest that the number of cybercrime victims in Africa is
growing. Former International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Secretary-General, Hamadoun Toure noted this trend with
trepidation and commented that cybercriminals saw Africa as a fertile ground for lucrative cybercrimes (Kshetri, 2019).
It is thus undeniable that changing and shifting economic activities that depend on digitisation attract cybercriminals, and African
countries with fast-growing economies are well advised to be ready to protect critical documents, vulnerable digital systems, as well
as industries and businesses from cyber threats (Peter, 2017). Institutions with financial resources are already investing heavily in
cybersecurity to safeguard their resources but, if cyberattacks are on the increase, these vast amounts of money will have been spent
in vain. In South Africa, many institutions, particularly those with significant financial capacity, are at high risk of cyberattacks
(South Africa, 2020). Online banking is a particularly vulnerable target as about 86% of the population frequently uses online banking
services in this country (Kshetri, 2019). Sadly, although cybercrime has been escalating significantly in South Africa, the lack of
resources in and the poor technical capability of the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) have limited its efforts to combat the swelling
wave of cybercrime and bring perpetrators to book. Therefore, as cybercrime figures continue to rise, South African citizens and
business operators must become more resilient in their efforts to defend their operations and/or safeguard their customers. According
to Mcanyana and Brindley (2020), iDefense suggests several measures to curb cybercrime such as improving security intelligence;
devising protection against internal threats and people-based attacks; and focusing on compliance, standards, and best practices. This
advice includes the following measures to ensure security and the threat of cyber invasion:
i. Protection against people-based attacks must be a top priority.
ii. Concentrate on safety/security compliance.
iii. Plan for when, not if (Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020).
According to Mcanyana and Brindley (2020), iDefense argues that security and threat intelligence is not only a central enabling
technology for both discovery and investigation activities, but it is also a valuable source of information for understanding threats
and making better use of resources in the face of an any impending cyberattack. Combating internal threats is still one of the most
difficult challenges that business management teams face today. Because of the rise in phishing, ransomware, and malicious insider
attacks, businesses must place great emphasis on cultivating a security-first culture. In this regard, training and education are critical
for reinforcing safe behaviours within an organisation and across the entire business ecosystem (Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020). Many
organisations already have data compliance tools and solutions in place to combat cybercrime. However, these tools are frequently
misconfigured. Data compliance occurs automatically when business tools and services are correctly installed and configured and
therefore particular emphasis should be placed on reducing ‘shadow’ ICT. Detection and ‘pre-breach’ preparation is thus vital in
every business where clear procedures for post-breach incidents should be established to ensure incident-response capability, postincident analysis, backed-up data, anti-Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) measures, and access to Cloud security brokers
(Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020).
Understanding the impact of cybercrime: A global phenomenon
Africa experiences hundreds of millions of cyberattacks annually (Kshetri, 2019). Internationally the economy remains heavily reliant
on the Internet but it is vulnerable to various risks and threats posed by cyberspace criminals (Saini, Rao, & Panda, 2012). In the
modern economy “stocks are traded via the Internet, bank transactions are performed via the Internet, and purchases are made using
credit cards via the Internet” (Saini, Rao, & Panda, 2012:206). As the international economy thus largely depends on cyberspace, its
disruption through cybercrime is a significant concern. Tsakalidis and Vergidis (2017) confirm that cybercrime offences pose a severe
threat to international economies, financial security concerns, and the pecuniary and even physical well-being of organisations and
individuals. A disruption in one region of the globe may have a ripple effect on many other regions and thus any disruption of the
cyber economy may result in a shock wave that may shake the world. The economic collapse of the property market in the USA in
2008 that caused financial devastation across the global economy clearly demonstrates this point. About this crisis, Calvo (2010:1)
writes the following in verbatim:
“The impact of the USA financial crisis that unfolded in 2008 has been global. It was felt in output, trade, and cross-border capital
flows and transfers. Incomes have dropped and consumption patterns are changing, placing at risk the human development gains of
the 1990s. At the heart of this global crisis is a credit crunch that has put financial strains on firms and individuals and has led to a
large number of job losses and drops in income from other sources ...The global financial crisis has had a severe impact on South
Africa. The economy went into recession in 2008/09 for the first time in 19 years. Nearly a million jobs were lost in 2009 alone and
the unemployment rate continued to remain high with 25%.”
The cost of cybercrime to the world economy is estimated at USA $500 billion [R7 658,50]. About 20% of Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises (SMEs) have been affected by the cybercrime scourge. More worrisome is that cybercriminals are targeting emerging
economies as they are easy targets that cybercriminals view as “low-hanging fruit” (Kshetri, 2019:77). The African economy in
particular has become a significant victim of cyber threats. Cybercrime in 2017 cost African economies USA $3.5 billion [R53 609 
Mphatheni and Maluleke, International Journal of Research in Business & Social Science 11(4) (2022), 384-396
390
500 000,00] (Kshetri, 2019). According to Serianu [Sa] (in Kshetri, 2019), who works for a Kenya-based IT and business advisory
firm, in Nigeria the annual total cost of cybercrime in 2017 was USA $649 million [R9 942 031 000,00] while Kenya lost USA$210
million [R3 216 990 000,00] to cybercrime. Kshetri (2019) further cites the South African Banking Risk Information Centre
(SABRIC) that asserts that South Africa loses about USA$157 million [R2 405 083 000,00] annually due to cyberattacks.
Subsequently, this estimate is above South Africa’s GDP, 350, USA$6 billion [R91 842 900 000,00], and the Nigerian GDP, which
is 521, US$8 billion. These two African countries are the continent's biggest economies (Fassassi & Akoussan, 2016). Nigeria is
reported to be severely suffering from the scourge of cybercrime as its economy is estimated to be losing USA$500 million per
annum [R7 653 575 000,00] (Fassassi & Akoussan, 2016). McGuire and Dowling (2013) argue that the overall estimated cost of
cybercrime in the United Kingdom (UK) is 27 billion euro. This figure was confirmed by by Detica (2011). The Ponemon Institute
published its analysis of the total cost of cybercrime for 58 public and private organisations in the USA in 2015. According to this
survey, the annual cost of cybercrime in this country had more than doubled since 2010, averaging USA$6.5 million [R99 530
925,00] (Ifinedo, 2018).
Banks and financial concerns that are the primary institutions used by the man on the street for financial support and safeguarding
are also highly vulnerable to financial cybercrime. In fact, the frequency of attacks on them by hackers is increasing (Fassassi &
Akoussan, 2016). Tsakalidis and Vergidis (2017) estimate that global cybercrime has cost the world USA$225 billion [R3 399 363
900 000,00]. Conversely, Fassassi and Akoussan (2016) estimate the global cost of cybercrime at USA$500 billion [R7 656 225 000
000,00]. Tsakalidis and Vergidis (2017) argue that technological advancements have posed a severe threat to global financial security
and national economies as they are all threatened by cybercrime. Cybercrime affects both the financial sector and individuals as it
ranges from identity theft to sexual exploitation (I.e. Particularly of children) and cyber harassment. The latter authors conclude that
the impacts of cybercrime range from minor discomfort to severe mental harm as well as huge public and financial losses. The table
below lists various aspects of discomfort and disruption caused by cybercriminals.

Based on a cybercrime victimisation survey, McGuire and Dowling (2013) argue that younger people and males who have access to
the Internet are most vulnerable to computer virus attacks. Saini, Rao, and Panda (2012) believe that organised syndicates are now
using the Internet to commit significant acts of fraud and theft and that cyberspace has opened up opportunities for criminals to shift
their activities from traditional criminal methods and spaces to the Internet, which has become a fertile space for fraud, identity theft,
and other computer-based acts of crime. Saini, Rao, and Panda (2012) add that these types of fraud have earned criminals millions
annually while investors have lost huge amounts. Cybercrime has caused the devastating disruption of computer functions and the
demise of many businesses and the financial collapse of numerous individuals. The development and improvement of technological
products and services are dependent on the exchange of data between individuals and businesses (Olano, 2018), but Internet users
are often unaware of the various cybercrimes that they might fall victim to and they thus do not take sufficient precautionary measures
to protect themselves against cyberattacks.
If ignored, cybercrime is a phenomenon that can cause irreparable harm to companies’ and individuals’ privacy, finances, and data
integrity. Cybercriminals use malicious codes to alter computer codes and data, which causes disruptions that fatally, compromises
data, leading to cybercrimes such as identity theft and data hacking (Burnap, French, Turner & Jones, 2018). For example, a
cyberattack on Sony resulted in irreparable damage when it lost an estimated USA$20 million [306 249 000,00] in revenue and
another USA$32 billion [R489 873 280 000,00] due to losing control of customer data (Hou, Gao, & Nicholson, 2018). Maintaining
privacy and data security has always been a problematic issue in the ICT domain as an extensive cyberattack could expose a large
portion of the population to unprecedented financial loss. Everyone in the corporate world and in society who uses the Internet is
vulnerable to cyber-criminals who are able to expose users’ particular vulnerabilities. Cyber-victimisation results in significant
economic and personal consequences for Internet users and has negative consequences for economies and the cyber infrastructure
(Barosy, 2019).

National security imperatives
Recognising the need to implement cybersecurity and well-protected investments is pivotal in curbing cybercrime. Only when both
the economic and social promise of the Internet are fully protected will economic dividends be secured, particularly in emerging
economies with relatively high Internet penetration and digital network readiness. The absence of cyber protection initiatives and the
implementation of effective measures pose high risks for both the public and private sectors (Peter, 2017). Pavlova (2020) highlights
that ‘peace and security’ are essential for economic growth but, regrettably, they can be and are undermined by crime and in
contemporary society, ‘peace and safety’ in both offline and cyberspace need to be ensured. It is unfortunate that governmental
institutions in particular are persistently struggling to ensure the safety and security of citizens’ data and information regardless of
the implementation of various protective measures. It seems that cybercriminals are always one-step ahead as officialdom has not
yet discarded the cloak of bureaucracy and red tape that has forever covered its operations like a shroud. One can only wonder how
difficult it really is to ensure peace, safety, and security within the cyberspace world.
Policing cybercrime has been acknowledged as a vital component of the LEA in recent years, but Clark and Hakim (2016) stress that
there is a need for more innovative strategies than those that have been used hitherto to deal with highly sophisticated acts of
cybercrime. The first step will of course be to address and eradicate policing deficits that often render policing in this field ineffective.
In this regard, the latter authors suggest that an integrated and collaborative approach should be adopted to ensure that all relevant
stakeholders in the public and private domains work together to devise and implement workable safety and security policies.
However, as policies are notorious poorly implemented and policed, practical implementation strategies need to be devised as a
matter of urgency. Pavlova (2020) summarises various methods that role players should adopt to ensure the safety of the cyberspace
domain. Clark and Hakim (2016) urge that the following measures are essential in securing cyber safety: i) Individuals need to play
a critical role as frontline users of the Internet in the fight against cyberspace crime; ii) Individuals, organisations, and governments
must frequently install anti-virus programmes, scour for viruses, and keep fire walls updated, and; iii) Individuals must be critical of
what they put online and which websites they enter.
Using a soccer metaphor, Clark and Hakim (2016) refer to ‘mid-field’ role players who are organisations whose primary goal is not
directed at safety in cyberspace but who function within the safety and security net that measures within cyberspace provide. For
example, the services of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), hard- and software producers, and Internet hotlines such as Internet Crime
Complaint Centre and the International Association of Internet Hotlines should be harnessed by both individuals and companies to
track and bring cybercrime perpetrators to book (Clark & Hakim 2016). These structures should play the role of the mid-fielder to
ensure safety and security within the cyberspace world. The ISPs also play a critical role in this regard, as they provide Internet access
to individual computer users as well as to organisations and industries. Clark and Hakim (2016) also argue that the last line of defence
against cyberspace threats is to rope in the support and services of existing institutions whose primary role it is to ensure the security
of the cyberspace world. The criminal justice system and the private security industry are pivotal role players in this regard. For
instance, commercial cybersecurity companies may be harnessed as key role players in combating criminal cyberspace acts, as they
already possess virus scanners and the ICT infrastructure to detect and identify cyberspace criminals. Unfortunately such
sophisticated services will come at great cost, and it seems logical that official LEA should invest their often wasted budgets in
procuring the necessary infrastructure and human resources to drive effective and functional anti-cybercrime units that are not
debilitated by red-tape and bureaucratic inefficiency.
Factors that enhance exposure to cybercrime
The Cybersecurity Exposure Index (CEI), which regularly surveys 108 countries on all continents worldwide (I.e. Europe, America,
Asia-Pacific, and Africa), lists the countries that are least and most affected by cybercrime. In terms of cybersecurity threats, Africa
is the most affected continent while Europe is the least exposed to cybersecurity threats (CEI, 2020). Finland, Denmark, Luxembourg,
Australia, and Estonia are the countries that are least exposed to cybercrime while African countries are highly vulnerable to
cybercrime as there is no single country on this continent that appears on the list of the world's most minor cybersecurity-exposed
countries. Afghanistan is the most vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, followed by Myanmar, Ethiopia, Palestine, and Venezuela. In
Africa Ethiopia is the country that experiences that highest threat to cybersecurity followed by Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Algeria, and
Cameroon. Namibia the least exposed to cybersecurity on the African continent. Countries in Africa with a high level of commitment
to cybersecurity are Mauritius at the top, followed by South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, and Uganda. Statistically, table
2, 3 and 4 showcased the most exposed countries to cybercrime, regional and international, together with the ranking of African
countries. Specifically, table reveals that on the international front, the United States ranked number one, followed by the UK and
Saudi Arabia, both in second place (Larnyoh, 2021).

The cyber threat landscape in South Africa
It seems that cyberspace offenders perceive industries and businesses in South Africa as inadequately defended compared to those in
affluent countries and they thus seize every opportunity to commit cyberspace offences here. Cyberspace criminals calculate the risk
of being caught − or receiving limited punishment when caught − and they thus target South Africa for the notoriety of its lenient
cybercrime policy (Africa Tech, 2020; and Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020). Cybercrime offenders have now started focusing on South
Africa due to insufficient and ineffective efforts to provide cybersecurity, the ineffective implementation of a policy framework and
the LEA instructions to curb cybercrime, and a lack of public knowledge on the cyberspace menace. Many other African countries
make inadequate cybersecurity investments due to being plagued by high crime rates, inequity and poverty, high unemployment
rates, and a skilled labour shortage. While many developing economies consider cybersecurity necessary, businesses frequently lack
the resources to invest in such protection. This limits their ability to implement measures to prevent and mitigate advanced threats in
cyberspace (Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020).
Cassim (2011) remains a critical researcher on this subject focusing on African countries,’ as it is noted that the available LEA
inadequacy to deal with cyber offences. The agencies in developing countries are generally not well equipped in terms of human
resources, intelligence networks, and infrastructure and they have inadequate and limited legislation to address cybercrime
comprehensively. For example, in South Africa, the National Assembly passed the Cyber Crimes Bill only in January 2020 as intense
public scrutiny of its impact on privacy and freedom of expression has resulted in delays. Furthermore, while the SAPS is now
authorised to prosecute such crimes, a lack of cybercrime training may pose challenges in the short term (Mcanyana & Brindley,
2020). According to the Africa Tech (2020), most developing countries consider cybersecurity necessary but they cannot invest
adequate funds due to pressing needs such as crime prevention, food deprivation, inequality, unemployment, and a lack of skilled
labour. Insight into the Cyber threat Landscape in South Africa (2020) supports the assertion that cybercrime occurs mainly because
of insufficient efforts to provide cybersecurity in South Africa. Cassim (2011: 127) agrees with the view that African countries’
priorities are not directed a cybersecurity as they are facing urgent challenges such as “...alleviating poverty, the Aids crisis, the fuel
crisis, political instability, ethnic instability, and traditional crimes such as murder, rape, and theft”. It is therefore logical that efforts
to address cybercrime and investments in cybersecurity are lagging.
Insight into the Cyber threat Landscape in South Africa (2020) also concurs with the notion that developing countries deem
cybersecurity important. However, they are unable to invest in such protection due to insufficient funds. Insight into the Cyber threat
Landscape in South Africa Insight into the Cyber threat Landscape in South Africa Insight into the Cyber threat Landscape in South
Africa. Moreover, industries in developing countries that can invest sufficient funds in cybersecurity are unable to do so because of
the lack of skilled practitioners in cybersecurity. It thus seems reasonable to argue that industries and organisations need to instil a
safety culture within their organisations and that businesses need to prioritise training and education for safe behavioural
reinforcement. The changing dynamics of the Internet that include the expansion of Internet capabilities and easy internet accessibility
are directly linked to new forms of criminal behaviour in cyberspace (Cassim, 2011). Such offences seem limitless, as the cyber
offender does not need to meet the victim at a certain place and time. This new form of crime thus requires specialised policies to
effectively address and curb them (Cassim, 2011). The call for new specialised laws to address cybercrime and provide cybersecurity
has been intensified because of the inability of existing laws to address the challenges offered by cyber offences in all countries and
in countries in Africa particularly.
South Africa has Africa's second-highest GDP and the second-fastest Internet and investments in new technological start-ups here is
brisk. The country is thus shifting to technological tools to meet a wide range of business and social needs. Analysts at iDefense,
however, note that South African Internet users are less experienced and technically ‘savvy’ than users in developed countries
(Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020). While cybercrime perpetrators continue to attempt to exploit digital platforms such as banking sites
and other locations that store financial data, the mitigation strategies these entities employ are typically robust but individuals remain
vulnerable to cybercrimes due to their low levels of technical acumen. For instance, personal devices and applications used on 
Mphatheni and Maluleke, International Journal of Research in Business & Social Science 11(4) (2022), 384-396
394
business networks can pose a significant risk by acting as entry points for ransomware or other infection vectors to infiltrate a network.
According to iDefense analysts, the use of shadow ICT or applications and infrastructure without knowing an enterprise’s ICT
department is common in South African businesses (Mcanyana & Brindley, 2020).
Conclusions
It is concluded that cybercrime and cybersecurity are concepts that have emerged in the last few decades. As a result, there is no
widely accepted definition for these concepts. Various scholars and international organisations have defined both concepts. However,
it is worth noting that one of the most popular definitions of cybercrime is a criminal activity that occurs in cyberspace and involves
a computer network and a network user. With the assistance of a computer, criminal activity can be committed against the computer
or the computer user. In contrast to traditional crime, cybercrime has no geographical boundaries. It does not necessitate any physical
contact between the offender and the victim. An individual, a company, or a country against someone or a company on a different
continent can commit it. Thus, Cybersecurity is a framework or set of measures in place or to be implemented to counteract any
cybercrime exposure. As a result, various industries, organisations, and countries developed cybersecurity frameworks. The global
economy’s reliance on cyberspace, combined with cybersecurity's failure to combat cybercrime, has had a significant economic
impact. The already struggling African economy has taken a significant hit because of cybercrime. African nations have made little
progress in combating the scourge of cybercrime. African countries appear to be vulnerable to cyberspace criminal activities due to
a lack of skilled labour and insufficient investment in cybersecurity by African nations. The struggle to combat traditional crimes
and poverty in Africa has resulted in less investment in cybersecurity. Collaboration between the government, scholars, and
organisations where information is shared is a shared interest in combating cybercrime and strengthening Cybersecurity.
There is currently no comprehensive international legal framework addressing Cybersecurity. International efforts to address the
issue have been limited in scope, focusing primarily on data privacy regulations and human rights, at the expense of a broader effort
to define and differentiate various levels of cyber aggression and codify an international response to its challenges. Nations will
continue to face difficulties assessing the legality of their response to a given attack in the absence of a comprehensive international
definition of the types of cyber aggression. The researchers’ further recommends that prevention measures aimed at combating
cybercrime are insufficient due to a lack of a universal definition of cybercrime. As a result, international organisations and the global
community must reach an agreement on what constitutes cybercrime. A shared understanding of what constitutes cybercrime will
aid in the effective prosecution of cybercrime. Combating cybercrime and ensuring cybersecurity necessitate global collaboration.
Moreover, local and regional organisations and businesses should have departments/units dedicated to dealing with cybercrime and
cybersecurity breaches. Personnel with advanced knowledge of cyberspace must be assigned to such a unit or department. Personnel
with extensive knowledge of cyberspace will deduce cybercriminals’ motivations and assist in apprehending the criminals and
devising new measures to prevent future cyberspace breaches. Cooperation among relevant stakeholders, including the public and
private sectors, is needed to implement safety and security policies. In addition, there should be an alternative strategy in place to
address policing deficiencies. African countries should collaborate to find effective ways of combating cybercrime and implementing
cybersecurity measures that bring peace, safety, and security to their respective nations. Cooperation among African countries will
result in a stable and robust cybersecurity infrastructure on the African continent. Avoiding cybercrime necessitates a focus on
security awareness training. Priority must be given to communication and the enforcement of security policies.
