# Literature Review: The Role of Buyers' Justice in Achieving Socially Sustainable Global Supply Chains

## Introduction

Supply chains in the apparel industry, particularly in developing countries, often face social issues such
as poor working conditions. The absence of an effective public model to address these issues has led
clothing brands and retailers to rely on private voluntary formal models. However, these models have
been criticized for not adequately addressing the root causes of these issues. This literature review aims
to explore the role of buyers' justice in ensuring suppliers' internal social performance. By examining
the relationship between buyers' justice and suppliers' social performance, this review seeks to identify
potential strategies for achieving socially sustainable global supply chains.

## Buyers' Justice and Suppliers' Internal Social Performance

The concept of buyers' justice refers to the fair practices and treatment of suppliers by buyers. According
to Alghababsheh et al. (2023), buyers' justice plays a crucial role in ensuring suppliers' internal social
performance. The study suggests that suppliers' internal social issues, such as poor working conditions,
can be driven by buyers' unfair practices. Therefore, it is essential to examine the impact of buyers' justice
on suppliers' social performance to address these issues effectively.

## Research Findings

Based on the research insights available, the following findings support the role of buyers' justice in
achieving socially sustainable global supply chains:

1. Buyers' justice positively influences suppliers' internal social performance (Alghababsheh et al., 2023).
   This finding suggests that when buyers engage in fair practices and treat suppliers ethically, it enhances
   suppliers' ability to maintain better social performance within their organizations.
2. The private voluntary formal model, which relies on compliance and collaboration approaches, has
   limitations in addressing suppliers' internal social issues (Alghababsheh et al., 2023). This indicates that
   the current approach used by clothing brands and retailers to manage social issues in their supply chains
   may not be effective in addressing the root causes of these issues.

## Gaps in Knowledge and Future Research Directions

While the research insights provide valuable information on the role of buyers' justice in achieving socially
sustainable global supply chains, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. These gaps

present opportunities for future research to further enhance our understanding of this topic. The following
are some potential future research directions:

1. **Exploring the mechanisms through which buyers' justice influences suppliers' internal social performance:** Future research could focus on identifying the specific practices and behaviors of buyers that
   contribute to improved social performance within supplier organizations. Understanding these mechanisms can help develop effective strategies for promoting buyers' justice and enhancing social sustainability
   in global supply chains.
2. **Evaluating the effectiveness of public models in addressing suppliers' social issues:** Since the
   private voluntary formal model has limitations, it is crucial to explore the effectiveness of public models,
   such as government regulations and law enforcement, in managing social issues in supply chains.
   Comparative studies could be conducted to assess the strengths and weaknesses of private and public
   models and identify ways to integrate them for better outcomes.
3. **Examining the perspectives of apparel suppliers and their workers:** The current research insights
   focus on the role of buyers' justice from the perspective of suppliers. Future research could involve
   conducting interviews or surveys with apparel suppliers and their workers to gain a comprehensive
   understanding of how buyers' justice impacts the social performance at the operational level. This would
   provide insights into the experiences and perceptions of those directly affected by buyers' practices.
4. **Investigating the role of other stakeholders in achieving socially sustainable supply chains:** While
   this literature review focuses on buyers' justice, it is important to consider the roles of other stakeholders,
   such as governments, NGOs, and consumers, in achieving socially sustainable global supply chains.
   Future research could explore the interactions and collaborations between these stakeholders and their
   impact on addressing social issues in supply chains.

## Conclusion

This literature review highlights the significance of buyers' justice in achieving socially sustainable
global supply chains in the apparel industry. The research findings suggest that buyers' fair practices
and treatment of suppliers can positively influence suppliers' internal social performance. However, the
limitations of the current private voluntary formal model emphasize the need for further research and
exploration of alternative approaches. By addressing the identified knowledge gaps and pursuing the
suggested future research directions, stakeholders can work towards more effective strategies for ensuring
social sustainability in global supply chains.
