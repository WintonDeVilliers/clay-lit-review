# Literature Review: Consolidating Cybersecurity in Europe: A Case Study on Job Profiles Assessment

## Introduction

In the field of cybersecurity, it is crucial to educate and train professionals with the specific skills and
competencies required to address the evolving challenges in the digital landscape. This literature review
aims to explore the existing research findings related to job profiles assessment and the consolidation of
cybersecurity in Europe. By synthesizing the available literature, this review will provide insights into
the educational needs and assessment frameworks for cybersecurity professionals. Additionally, it will
identify knowledge gaps and suggest potential future research directions.

## Research Findings

### Implementing an Entrustable Professional Activities Framework in Undergraduate Medical Education: Early Lessons From the AAMC Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency

Pilot
Lomis et al. (2017) discuss the implementation of an Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) framework
in medical education. The study emphasizes the shift from time-based learning to outcome-based learning
and highlights the importance of assessing learners' readiness to perform specific professional activities.
Although this study focuses on medical education, it provides insights into the use of EPA frameworks
for assessing professionals' competencies in a specific domain.

### National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce
Framework (2017) to provide a common language for describing and categorizing cybersecurity work
roles. This framework defines a set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for various
cybersecurity job roles. While this framework is not specific to Europe, it offers a comprehensive
framework that can be adapted and utilized for consolidating cybersecurity job profiles assessment in
Europe.

### Constructing a Validity Argument for the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills

(OSATS): A Systematic Review of Validity Evidence
Hatala et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review to construct a validity argument for the Objective
Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) in medical education. The study highlights the
importance of establishing the validity of assessment methods, including the assessment of technical

skills. This finding emphasizes the need for valid and reliable assessment frameworks in cybersecurity
job profiles assessment.

### Entrustable Professional Activities in Healthcare Education: A Scoping Review

Shorey et al. (2019) conducted a scoping review to explore the use of Entrustable Professional Activities
(EPAs) in healthcare education. The study provides insights into the application of EPAs as a framework
for assessing and entrusting learners with professional activities. While this study focuses on healthcare
education, it offers valuable insights that can be applied to the assessment of cybersecurity professionals'
competencies and job profiles.

### The Future Cybersecurity Workforce: Going Beyond Technical Skills for Successful Cyber Performance

Dawson and Thomson (2018) argue that successful performance in cybersecurity requires more than just
technical skills. The study highlights the importance of non-technical skills, such as communication,
problem-solving, and ethical decision-making, in cybersecurity professionals. This finding suggests the
need to consider a holistic approach to job profiles assessment in cybersecurity, encompassing both
technical and non-technical skills.

### Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)

The NIST Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (2020) provides a comprehensive set of knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for cybersecurity professionals. This framework categorizes cybersecurity work roles and defines the KSAs associated with each role. While this framework is not
specific to Europe, it offers a valuable resource for developing a standardized framework for consolidating
cybersecurity job profiles assessment.

### Influence of Human Factors on Cyber Security within Healthcare Organizations: A Systematic

Review
Nifakos et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review to explore the influence of human factors on
cybersecurity within healthcare organizations. The study highlights the importance of considering human
factors, such as user behavior and organizational culture, in cybersecurity assessments. This finding
suggests the need to incorporate human factors assessment into the job profiles assessment framework
for cybersecurity professionals.

### Expert Assessment of the Top Platform Independent Cybersecurity Skills for Non-IT Professionals

Carlton and Levy (2015) conducted an expert assessment to identify the top platform-independent
cybersecurity skills for non-IT professionals. The study highlights the importance of assessing and
developing cybersecurity skills among professionals from diverse backgrounds. This finding suggests the

need to consider the specific skills required for different job profiles in cybersecurity while developing
the assessment framework.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Based on the reviewed literature, several knowledge gaps and potential future research directions can be
identified:

1. **Contextualization of Assessment Framework**: The existing literature provides valuable insights
   into assessment frameworks and competencies required for cybersecurity professionals. However, there is
   a need for further research to contextualize these frameworks specifically for the European cybersecurity
   landscape.
2. **Validation of Assessment Methods**: While some studies discuss the importance of validity in
   assessment methods, there is a need for further research to validate the assessment methods used for
   job profiles assessment in cybersecurity. This can involve conducting empirical studies to establish the
   validity and reliability of assessment tools and frameworks.
3. **Integration of Non-Technical Skills**: The literature highlights the importance of non-technical
   skills in cybersecurity professionals. Future research should focus on integrating the assessment of
   non-technical skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and ethical decision-making, into the job
   profiles assessment framework.
4. **Human Factors Assessment**: The influence of human factors on cybersecurity is an emerging
   area of research. Future studies should explore the incorporation of human factors assessment, such as
   user behavior and organizational culture, into the job profiles assessment framework for cybersecurity
   professionals.
5. **Adaptation of Frameworks for European Context**: The existing frameworks, such as the NICE
   Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, need to be adapted to the European context. Future research should
   focus on developing a standardized framework that addresses the specific needs and requirements of the
   European cybersecurity landscape.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this literature review provides insights into the assessment of job profiles in the field
of cybersecurity. The reviewed research findings highlight the importance of assessment frameworks,

validation of assessment methods, integration of non-technical skills, consideration of human factors,
and the adaptation of existing frameworks for the European context. The identified knowledge gaps and
potential future research directions provide a roadmap for further research in consolidating cybersecurity
job profiles assessment in Europe. By addressing these gaps, policymakers and educators can develop
effective strategies for educating and training cybersecurity professionals with the required competencies
to tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges.
