# Literature Review: Social Media Users' Online Subjective Well-being and Fatigue: A Network Heterogeneity Perspective

## Introduction

The rise of social media has had a significant impact on society, leading to both optimism about
the potential benefits and concerns about the potential harms associated with its use. This literature
review aims to explore the relationship between social media use and online subjective well-being and
fatigue. It integrates and synthesizes the research findings from two studies to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the topic.

## Study 1: The Welfare Effects of Social Media

In their study, Allcott, Braghieri, Eichmeyer, and Gentzkow (2019) conducted a randomized experiment to
examine the effects of deactivating Facebook on individuals' online activity, offline activities, factual news
knowledge, political polarization, subjective well-being, post-experiment Facebook use, and valuations
of Facebook. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the relationship between social
media use and subjective well-being.
The results of the experiment revealed several key findings. First, deactivating Facebook led to a reduction
in online activity, indicating that individuals' engagement with the platform decreased during the study
period. However, it also resulted in an increase in offline activities, such as watching TV alone and
socializing with family and friends. This suggests that individuals substituted their online activities with
offline interactions and leisure activities.
Second, the deactivation of Facebook had a positive impact on individuals' factual news knowledge and
reduced political polarization. By disconnecting from the platform, individuals were less exposed to
biased information and echo chambers, leading to a more balanced understanding of political issues.
Third, deactivating Facebook increased individuals' subjective well-being. This finding implies that
excessive use of social media may have a negative impact on individuals' well-being. By taking a break
from Facebook, individuals experienced an improvement in their overall well-being.
Lastly, deactivation of Facebook resulted in reduced post-experiment valuations of the platform. This

suggests that individuals' perception of Facebook's value and utility may be inflated when they are actively
using the platform. The study highlights the importance of considering alternative metrics to assess
consumer surplus accurately.
Overall, the findings of this study indicate that deactivating Facebook can lead to positive outcomes, such
as increased well-being, reduced political polarization, and a shift towards offline activities. However,
further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of social media deactivation on individuals'
well-being and how these findings may be generalized to other social media platforms.

## Study 2: The Relationship Between Mobile Phone Use and Subjective Well-being

Rogan and Mors (2014) conducted a national survey to investigate the relationship between different uses
of mobile phones and individuals' subjective well-being and social capital. Adopting an affordance-based
approach, the study examined how voice and online communication, non-communicative uses, and
passing time activities were related to subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital.
The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the consequences of mobile phone use on
individuals' well-being and social capital. The results revealed that both voice and online communication
with mobile phones were positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding
and bridging capital. This suggests that using mobile phones for communication purposes can enhance
individuals' well-being and social connections.
Moreover, the study found that both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between
mobile phone use and subjective well-being. This implies that the positive effects of mobile phone use on
well-being can be partly explained by the strengthening of social ties within existing networks (bonding
capital) and the expansion of social connections with individuals from different social groups (bridging
capital).
On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively
related to positive affect. This suggests that passive consumption of information through mobile phones
may have a detrimental effect on individuals' well-being by reducing positive emotions.
Furthermore, passing time activities, which involve activities like scrolling through social media feeds
or playing games, were positively related to negative affect. This finding suggests that engaging in such
activities as a means of time-passing may lead to negative emotional experiences.
The findings of this study have implications for understanding the complex relationship between mobile

phone use, subjective well-being, and social capital. It highlights the importance of considering the
specific uses and affordances of mobile phones when examining their effects on individuals' well-being.
Future research could explore the potential mediating mechanisms that explain the relationships between
different uses of mobile phones, subjective well-being, and social capital.

## Conclusion

This literature review has provided a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between social
media use and online subjective well-being and fatigue. The findings from the two studies highlight the
complex nature of this relationship and suggest potential directions for future research.
The study by Allcott et al. (2019) demonstrates that deactivating Facebook can lead to positive outcomes,
such as increased well-being and reduced political polarization. However, further research is needed to
understand the long-term effects of social media deactivation on individuals' well-being and to explore
the generalizability of these findings to other social media platforms.
The study by Rogan and Mors (2014) shows that different uses of mobile phones have varying effects
on individuals' well-being and social capital. Future research could delve deeper into the mediating
mechanisms that explain these relationships and consider the affordances of other emerging technologies
in relation to subjective well-being.
Overall, this literature review emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of the impact of technology on individuals' well-being and highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of social media use.
By integrating and synthesizing the research findings, this review contributes to the existing knowledge
on technological forecasting and social change, providing insights for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers.
