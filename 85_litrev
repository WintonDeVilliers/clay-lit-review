# Literature Review: Measuring the Impact of the Digital Economy in Developing Countries

## Introduction

The digital economy, driven by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), has become increasingly important in recent years. It has the potential to contribute significantly to the economic growth and
development of developing countries. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis
of the research findings related to measuring the impact of the digital economy in developing countries.
The review will synthesize the available evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest potential future
research directions.

## Overview of the Digital Economy in Developing Countries

The digital economy is estimated to make up around 5% of global GDP and 3% of global employment
(Bukht & Heeks, 2017). This highlights the growing importance of the digital economy in the global
context. However, it is crucial to understand the specific impact of the digital economy in developing
countries, as they often face unique challenges and opportunities.

## Economic Implications of the Digital Economy

The digital economy has significant economic implications for developing countries. It has the potential
to drive economic growth, create employment opportunities, and enhance productivity. A systematic
literature review by Tremmel et al. (2017) on the economic burden of obesity found that the digital
economy can contribute to the overall GDP of a country.
Furthermore, the digital economy has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes in developing countries. For instance, mHealth behavior change communication interventions have been found to be effective
in improving health outcomes in developing countries (Gurman et al., 2012). This suggests that the digital
economy can have a positive impact on the healthcare sector in developing countries.

## Measurement of the Digital Economy

Accurately measuring the impact of the digital economy in developing countries is essential for policymakers and researchers. However, defining, conceptualizing, and measuring the digital economy is a

complex task. Bukht and Heeks (2017) highlight the challenges associated with defining and measuring
the digital economy. They argue that a clear and comprehensive framework is needed to measure the
different dimensions of the digital economy accurately.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the available research provides valuable insights into the impact of the digital economy in
developing countries, there are several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research. First,
there is a need for more studies that specifically focus on the digital economy in developing countries.
Many of the studies reviewed in this literature review were conducted in developed countries, and the
findings may not be directly applicable to developing countries.
Second, there is a need for more comprehensive and standardized metrics to measure the impact of the
digital economy in developing countries. The existing literature highlights the challenges associated with
defining and measuring the digital economy accurately. Future research should aim to develop robust
metrics that capture the multidimensional nature of the digital economy in developing countries.
Third, there is a need for more research on the specific sectors that are most impacted by the digital
economy in developing countries. While the available evidence suggests that the digital economy has
economic implications across various sectors, more research is needed to understand the sector-specific
impact and potential for growth.
Lastly, there is a need for more research on the social and cultural implications of the digital economy
in developing countries. The existing literature primarily focuses on the economic impact, but there is a
lack of research on the broader social and cultural implications. Future research should aim to explore the
social and cultural changes brought about by the digital economy and their implications for development
in developing countries.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the digital economy has the potential to make a significant impact on developing countries.
It can contribute to economic growth, create employment opportunities, and improve healthcare outcomes.
However, accurately measuring the impact of the digital economy in developing countries is a complex
task. Future research should focus on addressing the knowledge gaps and developing comprehensive metrics to measure the impact of the digital economy accurately. By doing so, policymakers and researchers
can better understand the potential of the digital economy to drive development in developing countries.
