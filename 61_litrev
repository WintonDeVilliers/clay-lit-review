# Literature Review: SME Risk Management Practices in South Africa

## Introduction

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in the South African economy by providing
employment opportunities and fostering entrepreneurship. However, the high failure rate of SMEs in
South Africa indicates a lack of effective risk management practices. This literature review aims to explore
the current state of SME risk management practices in South Africa, highlighting the ignorance of SME
owner-managers regarding the risks their enterprises face and their reactive and ineffective deployment
of risk management techniques.

## Risk Management in SMEs

Falkner and Hiebl (2015) conducted a systematic review of available evidence regarding risk management
in SMEs. The study identified various types of risks that may occur in SMEs, including financial,
operational, strategic, and reputational risks. These risks can significantly impact the survival and success
of SMEs. The authors emphasized the importance of implementing a structured risk management process
in SMEs to mitigate these risks effectively.

## Ignorance of SME Owner-Managers

One of the key findings in the literature is the lack of awareness among SME owner-managers regarding
the risks their enterprises face. According to Yolande Smit and J. A. Watkins (2012), SME owner-managers
in South Africa are ignorant of the risks their enterprises face and tend to deploy risk management
techniques reactively. This reactive approach to risk management is ineffective and fails to address
potential risks proactively.

## Ineffective Deployment of Risk Management Techniques

The literature review by Yolande Smit and J. A. Watkins (2012) also highlighted the ineffectiveness of risk
management techniques deployed by SME owner-managers in South Africa. The authors found that these
techniques are often deployed in a reactive manner, meaning that risks are only addressed after they occur.
This approach limits the ability of SMEs to prevent or mitigate risks effectively, leading to a higher failure
rate in the South African SME sector.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the literature review provides valuable insights into the state of SME risk management practices in
South Africa, several knowledge gaps and areas for future research can be identified. These include:

1. **Understanding the specific challenges faced by SMEs in South Africa:** Further research is needed
   to explore the unique challenges that SMEs in South Africa face concerning risk management. This will
   enable the development of tailored risk management strategies for the South African SME context.
2. **Exploring the factors contributing to SME owner-managers' ignorance:** Future research should
   investigate the underlying factors that contribute to the lack of awareness among SME owner-managers
   regarding the risks their enterprises face. This understanding will help in designing interventions and
   educational programs to improve risk management practices among SMEs in South Africa.
3. **Assessing the effectiveness of proactive risk management strategies:** It is essential to evaluate the
   effectiveness of proactive risk management strategies in the context of South African SMEs. This will help
   establish best practices and guidelines for SMEs to implement proactive risk management techniques,
   reducing the failure rate and enhancing the overall resilience of SMEs in South Africa.
4. **Examining the role of government policies and support:** Future research should investigate the
   role of government policies and support in promoting effective risk management practices among SMEs
   in South Africa. This will help identify potential barriers or facilitators that impact the adoption and
   implementation of risk management strategies in the SME sector.

## Conclusion

This literature review highlights the current state of SME risk management practices in South Africa.
The findings indicate that SME owner-managers in South Africa are generally ignorant of the risks
their enterprises face and tend to deploy risk management techniques reactively and ineffectively. To
address these challenges, further research is needed to understand the specific challenges faced by SMEs,
explore the factors contributing to SME owner-managers' ignorance, assess the effectiveness of proactive
risk management strategies, and examine the role of government policies and support in promoting
effective risk management practices among SMEs in South Africa. By addressing these knowledge gaps,
policymakers, practitioners, and researchers can work together to improve the risk management practices
of SMEs in South Africa and enhance their overall success and contribution to the economy.
