ABSTRACT
With the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), it is crucial to acknowledge
the potential security and privacy issues that arise from these advanced technologies in smart cities. This article
provides overview of these concerns, highlighting the various ways in which smart city technologies can be
vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy
protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities
to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public
safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to
privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate
power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital
infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has
increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In
addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of
hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better
understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address
them. This article shows as a valuable resource for city administrators, policymakers and researchers interested
in the security and privacy concerns of smart cities.
1. Introduction
Cities have been a focal point of interest for scholars from various
fields due to their significance as the birthplace of human civilization.
The complex nature of urban environments has inspired scholars to
explore ways to improve and develop new urban structures to address
issues and improve living standards (Guo and Zhong, 2022, Guo et al.,
2022, Yu and Zhou, 2023, Camero and Alba, 2019). In the 21st century,
information technology has emerged as a critical driver of transformation and development worldwide, with significant impact on society, welfare, and comfort. Information and communication
technologies play a pivotal role in the economic, social, and political
domains, and have led to the rise of smart cities and electronic cities as
solutions to urban problems, attracting the attention of urban planners
and city managers (Lv, Chen, and Lv, 2022, Shelton, Zook, and Wiig,
2015, Bakıcı, Almirall, and Wareham, 2013, Vanolo, 2014, et al., 2022).
The article also discusses the challenges associated with establishing
electronic cities and emphasizes the importance of ensuring public
safety and protecting the privacy of residents against threats. An effective security measures and privacy protection policies in smart cities
include secure data collection, robust authentication and authorization,
regular security assessments, privacy-by-design principles, and transparency and accountability. Successful implementations of these policies in existing smart cities, such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Seoul,
demonstrate the importance of safeguarding individuals’ privacy rights
while leveraging the benefits of data-driven technologies.

A conceptual-execution model has been developed for seamless
interaction between smart cities, electronic cities, and relevant organizations and departments, incorporating hardware and software infrastructure, developing city-wide parking, data and information
acquisition processes, analysis, and system output (Dameri, 2017, Nam
and Pardo, 2011, Eremia, Toma, and Sanduleac, 2017, Alawadhi et al.,
2012, Zubizarreta, Seravalli, and Arrizabalaga, 2016). The study reveals
that many well-known cities worldwide have adopted information and
communication technologies in line with the trend of smart cities,
electronic cities, and electronic municipalities. Governments worldwide
are increasingly adopting new technologies to safeguard public infrastructure and promote innovation and human progress (Falconer and
Mitchell, 2012, Calzada and Cobo, 2015, Neirotti et al., 2014).
The primary objective of establishing a safe city is to create a unified
monitoring system that allows multiple stakeholders and various security systems to interact with each other. Smart cities require three key
dimensions: hardware and software, database management, and operational management systems. This involves deploying a network of
sensors that communicate information to relevant stations via various
communication channels (Zubizarreta, Seravalli, and Arrizabalaga,
2016, Falconer and Mitchell, 2012, Calzada and Cobo, 2015, Neirotti
et al., 2014). The installation of smart hardware and software is the first
step in designing a smart city, followed by developing and managing an
efficient database capable of translating and reflecting implemented
infrastructure networks. To minimize energy consumption and costs, an
efficient automation framework is also required for management systems. Smart technology has become ubiquitous in various aspects of life,
including healthcare, education, governance, environment, transportation, and energy. Smart governance and economy aim to promote
economic growth, reduce government expenses, and safeguard human
well-being, mental tranquility, and citizen privacy. However, the
growing complexity of technology and interdependence of operational
and system management increase the risk of hackers exploiting the
smart city environment (Kim, Ramos, and Mohammed, 2017, Kirimtat
et al., 2020, Al-Hader et al., 2009, Cardullo, Di Feliciantonio, and
Kitchin, 2019, Morozov and Bria, 2018, Angelidou, 2017).
Failure to incorporate cybersecurity and privacy considerations in
smart city planning can have severe consequences. Therefore, establishing a cybersecurity governance model for smart cities is crucial to
protect confidential data and maintain the integrity and availability of
services. A successful cybersecurity governance model requires a complete understanding of the various security risks associated with smart
city technologies, including IoT devices (Komninos, 2007, Caragliu and
Bo, 2019, Batty et al., 2012, Law and Lynch, 2019, Kumar and Dahiya,
2017, Batty, 2018, Riffat, Powell, and Aydin, 2016, Sallis et al., 2016,
Jameson, 2003, Brook, 2013, Ackerman et al., 2014). Regular identification and evaluation of these risks are necessary to ensure appropriate
and effective security measures. Comprehensive security policies and
procedures should be developed and implemented to ensure that all
stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining
cybersecurity and comply with relevant laws and regulations. Regular
training and awareness programs should be provided to promote a
culture of cybersecurity and ensure that everyone is equipped with the
necessary skills to identify and respond to security threats (Bughin,
Byers, and Chui, 2011, Hagen and Robertson, 2010, Jarrahi and Sawyer,
2013). A formal incident response plan should be developed, tested
regularly, and updated as necessary to address potential cybersecurity
incidents. Regular audits and assessments should be conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity governance model and
identify areas for improvement. The governance model should remain
adaptable and flexible in response to evolving threats and advancements
in technology, with strong leadership and a steadfast commitment to
continuous improvement (Li, 2010, Leonardi, Huysman, and Steinfield,
2013, Bacigalupe, 2011, Guinan, Parise, and Rollag, 2014). This
research aims to examine the integration of emerging technologies such
as smart city development, big data analytics, machine learning, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) in preserving security and privacy for citizens. The study provides valuable insights into the application of technology and AI in addressing security challenges in smart
cities (Gaisina et al., 2015, Moos, 2009, Leibetseder, 2011, Fawcett
et al., 1984). While various techniques have been adopted to maintain
sustainable security, none have addressed the key challenges using a
combination of approaches. The conventional data processing tools
available are inadequate to meet the objectives of cities due to the
enormous volume of real-time data generated by rapid urbanization.
Preserving citizens’ privacy poses significant challenges, including surveillance and maintaining order in urban operations. Therefore, integrating big data technology with other emerging technologies in the
cybersecurity sector is urgently needed. This article focuses on studying
technology-oriented development in smart cities and preserving citizens’ security and privacy (Hagen and Robertson, 2010, Jarrahi and
Sawyer, 2013, Li, 2010, Leonardi, Huysman, and Steinfield, 2013,
Bacigalupe, 2011, Guinan, Parise, and Rollag, 2014, Gaisina et al., 2015,
Pelikan, 2003, McCormick and Scrimshaw, 2001, Webb and Cox, 2004).
A comprehensive review of representative studies is presented, highlighting the development of technology in smart cities to enhance citizens’ quality of life. The article covers various topics, including (1)
future smart cities, (2) technology-oriented development in smart cities
and their emergence, (3) citizen security and privacy preservation, (4)
surveillance and order creation using AI, and (5) key elements in urban
operations. The research methodology involves reviewing numerous
scholarly sources and datasets to provide evidence-based insights into
the development of smart cities.
2. Research methodology of smart cities
2.1. Innovative optimization model for effective resource management
This paper presents a novel Theory-dependent Innovative Optimization Model (TIOM) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to
manage limited resources effectively in smart cities. The TIOM model
utilizes conflict theory to balance production output, supply, and enterprise values, and incorporates historical data to analyze stock availability, resource depletion, and market demand forecasts. The model
encourages productivity and product circulation while addressing economic and resource-related issues. The primary contribution of this
research is the development of the TIOM model, which provides a
practical and integrated approach to addressing the security and privacy
concerns of smart cities while promoting economic growth and resource
management. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed
model by comparing the performance of enterprises using the model
with those not using the model. The study shows the infrastructure
utilized to examine urban operations against objectives, including unit
definition, classification field selection, literature collection, and drawing, as well as material analysis or evaluation. The literature review
presents over 100 research articles and 100-120 reference sources,
divided into two main sections: a review of research on the reasons and
emergence of smart cities, and an examination of AI and cyber security
technologies used to protect citizens’ privacy. A comprehensive cybersecurity governance model for smart cities should include risk management, policies and regulations, collaboration and coordination,
incident response, and education and awareness. The governance model
should also address the unique challenges and complexities of securing a
smart city environment, including interconnectedness, data volume and
variety, multiple stakeholders, and rapid technological advancements.
Table 1 presents an overview of the role and position of ICT in smart
cities. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how ICT is used to
support the functioning of smart cities and the benefits it brings to citizens, businesses, and governments. In this study, we conducted a
comprehensive search for relevant articles using databases, relevant
books, journals, and published statistics in the field of smart city, complete life cycle, Urban security, and AI.

The paper shows practical applications for addressing the issues
discussed, with several cities (7 cities) chosen as examples to examine
the role and position of Information and communication technology
(ICT) and their respective objectives. Table 2 shows a comprehensive
compilation with various cases and methods that affect social data and
quality indicators in smart cities, including but not limited to security
protocols, virtual space application usage, user motivation models in
both social and technological settings, and more. These findings have
been documented in previous research studies (Fawcett et al., 1984,
Pelikan, 2003, McCormick and Scrimshaw, 2001, Webb and Cox, 2004,
Mumtaz, 2000, Selwyn et al., 2003, Kirschner and Selinger, 2003,
Giannopoulos, 2004). The proposed Theory-dependent Innovative
Optimization Model (TIOM) can be applied to various industries and
sectors in smart cities to optimize resource management while
addressing security and privacy concerns. One such industry is the fertilizer complex industry, which is known to emit gaseous pollutants that
can have a negative impact on the environment and human health.
2.2. Literature on the role of technology in enhancing citizens’ quality of
life
The motivation for researching and studying smart cities and their
various aspects is to develop sustainable solutions that can address the
challenges faced by modern cities. Rapid urbanization has led to a host
of problems such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and resource
depletion. Smart city development presents a promising solution to
improve the quality of life of citizens while also addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges. By exploring a range of technologies and solutions to improve security and privacy protection, data
governance, environmental sustainability, and public-private partnerships, innovative and effective solutions can be developed for smart city
development. Ultimately, the goal of studying smart cities is to create
better, more livable, and sustainable cities for everyone. The study
specifically explores the definition of smart cities and its various interpretations, with a focus on the role of technology in enhancing citizens’ quality of life. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature
search was conducted using electronic databases such as Scopus, Web of
Science (WOS), and Google Scholar, limited to articles published in
English from 2010 to 2023 in field of smart city, cybersecurity and
electronic government. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles that
focused on the concept of smart cities, their development, and their
impact on urban operations and citizens’ quality of life, while exclusion
criteria were articles that were not relevant to the research questions or
were duplicates. A total of 50-70 articles were included in the final
analysis, and a thematic analysis approach was used to synthesize the
findings. The identified themes included the definition of smart cities,
the role of technology in smart city development, challenges and opportunities, and the impact of smart cities on citizens. The study concludes with recommendations for future research in the field of smart
cities.
2.3. Balancing complexity and innovation to enhance quality of life
Cities are increasingly utilizing ICT to become "smart cities" in order
to enhance operational efficiency, citizen engagement, and service delivery. The definition of a smart city varies depending on the community
it serves, but generally, it aims to improve urban operations and promote economic growth while utilizing data analysis and modern technologies to enhance citizens’ quality of life. However, achieving these
goals is challenging due to the inherent complexity of cities and the
challenges they face. The concentration of residents in cities can lead to
disorder and chaos, making it difficult to achieve sustainability through
traditional urban administration and development methods. To address
these challenges, urban planners are developing new models for future
cities that take a holistic approach to urbanization by integrating all
aspects of development. One such model is the smart city, which

combines the capabilities of the real and virtual worlds to solve urban
problems and is viewed as a key driver for transformation and development in the current millennium. Despite the significant literature on
smart cities, a clear understanding and consensus on its definition
remain elusive, with varying interpretations among researchers. While
some emphasize the importance of smart technologies, others take a
broader perspective. It is crucial to adopt an approach that empowers
citizens by adapting technology to their needs and avoiding a narrow
focus on technology. Furthermore, the definition of a smart city is
multifaceted and depends on contextual conditions such as political
system, geography, and technology diffusion. Innovation involves
implementing and applying new ideas and approaches to solve realworld problems, going beyond theoretical concepts to demonstrate the
practical value of research. An innovative study on smart cities may use
emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning
to develop predictive models for urban planning and management. Such
applications of research findings can help address real-world challenges
and improve the quality of life for citizens. By fostering innovation,
researchers can contribute to the development of smarter, more sustainable, and more livable cities for the future (Lv, Chen, and Lv, 2022,
Nam and Pardo, 2011).
The article’s findings can contribute to knowledge advancement by
providing insights into the challenges that arise when implementing
smart city applications and identifying potential solutions. By highlighting the importance of citizen privacy protection, the article can
guide policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in developing ethical
and responsible smart city initiatives that prioritize the rights and wellbeing of citizens. This article can contribute to the development of
smarter, more sustainable, and more livable cities by providing a
comprehensive review of challenges and solutions in the field of smart
cities. Addressing the security and privacy concerns of smart cities requires collaborative efforts and interdisciplinary approaches that
involve city administrators, policymakers, researchers, and other
stakeholders. The continuous improvement of security measures and
privacy protection in smart city environments requires the establishment of governance frameworks, interdisciplinary research teams,
multi-stakeholder partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms.
2.4. Data analysis for improved urban life and sustainability
The benefits of smart cities are numerous and far-reaching. Smart
cities aim to improve the quality of life for citizens by providing better
access to essential services such as healthcare, education, transportation, and public safety. Many studies also aim to enhance the
sustainability of urban areas by promoting energy efficiency, renewable
energy, and circular economy principles. Smart cities can also create
new job opportunities in technology and service sectors, attract investment, and foster entrepreneurship and innovation. Smart solutions
cannot be blindly copied and must be evaluated for their applicability to
different issues. Effective smart cities must also include data analysts
who can evaluate the information provided by smart city systems to
identify problems and opportunities for improvement. The primary goal
of a smart city is to optimize city performance, promote economic
growth, and enhance citizens’ quality of life by leveraging smart technologies and data analysis (Alawadhi et al., 2012, Zubizarreta, Seravalli,
and Arrizabalaga, 2016, Falconer and Mitchell, 2012, Calzada and
Cobo, 2015, Neirotti et al., 2014, Kim, Ramos, and Mohammed, 2017). It
is not simply about the quantity of technology available, but how it is
used. To provide connected solutions to the public, smart cities rely on
various software, user interfaces, communication networks, and the
Internet of Things (IoT), which is a network of interconnected devices
that communicate and exchange data. The IoT can include everything
from vehicles to home appliances and street sensors, and data collected
from these devices are stored on servers to improve public and private
sector efficiency, bring economic benefits, and enhance citizens’ lives.
Edge computing, which sends only the most important data to the server
through the communication network, is often used by IoT devices.
Additionally, a security system is essential to protect, monitor, and
control data transmission from the smart city network and prevent unauthorized access to the city’s IoT network (Zubizarreta, Seravalli, and
Arrizabalaga, 2016, Falconer and Mitchell, 2012). The amalgamation of
automation, machine learning, and the IoT has facilitated the implementation of various smart city technologies. A smart parking systems
can assist drivers in locating parking spots and facilitate digital payments. Another example is the intelligent traffic management system
that monitors traffic flow and optimizes traffic signals to alleviate
congestion, while ride-sharing services can also be managed using smart
city infrastructure (Calzada and Cobo, 2015). In addition, smart city
features can promote energy savings and environmental efficiency, such
as street lights dimming during low traffic hours. These smart grid
technologies can enhance everything from operations and maintenance
to scheduling and power supply. Smart city plans can also help combat
climate change and air pollution, as well as waste and sanitation management via internet-enabled waste collection, bins, and fleet management systems. Furthermore, smart cities can offer safety measures such
as monitoring high crime areas or using sensors to activate early
warning systems for natural disasters like floods, landslides, storms, or
droughts (Neirotti et al., 2014, Kim, Ramos, and Mohammed, 2017). A
further research is needed in several key areas to better understand the
risks associated with smart city technologies and develop effective solutions to mitigate those risks. Specific technological advancements and
emerging trends, such as IoT security, 5G networks, and AI and machine
learning, require attention in terms of security and privacy in smart
cities.
2.5. Building a smart future and economic growth
Smart buildings can also facilitate real-time space management and
structural health monitoring, providing feedback on when repairs are
required. By accessing this system, citizens can also report problems
such as potholes, while sensors can monitor infrastructure issues like
water pipe leaks. Additionally, smart city technology can improve production efficiency, urban agriculture, energy consumption, and more
(Kirimtat et al., 2020). Smart cities can integrate various services to
provide common solutions for citizens. The development of smart cities
can be categorized into three generations. The first generation focused
on understanding the impact of technology on daily life, while the second generation explored how technology and innovation can address
urban challenges (Al-Hader et al., 2009). The third generation shifted
control to the public, encouraging social engagement and community
participation. Vienna is an example of a city that adopted this
third-generation model and partnered with the local energy company to
enable citizens to invest in solar power plants and address issues of
gender equality and affordable housing. Vancouver is another city
where citizens created the Vancouver Greenest City 2020 Action Plan to
improve sustainability (Cardullo, Di Feliciantonio, and Kitchin, 2019,
Morozov and Bria, 2018). Smart cities follow a four-step process to
enhance the quality of life and promote economic growth through
connected IoT devices and other technologies. Real-time data is
collected by smart sensors, analyzed to gain insights into city operations,
communicated to decision-makers to improve performance, and used to
manage assets and enhance the city’s quality of life (Al-Hader et al.,
2009, Cardullo, Di Feliciantonio, and Kitchin, 2019, Morozov and Bria,
2018, Angelidou, 2017, Komninos, 2007). Citizens can also engage with
smart city ecosystems through mobile devices, connected vehicles, and
buildings. By integrating devices, data, and infrastructure, smart cities
can reduce costs, increase sustainability, and streamline operations such
as energy distribution and waste collection, as well as improve air
quality and reduce traffic congestion (Caragliu and Bo, 2019). A smart
city should aim to provide a high quality of life for residents and promote economic growth by delivering shared services at a reduced

infrastructure cost. This is particularly important for urban areas facing
population growth where infrastructure and assets must be used efficiently (Batty et al., 2012). Smart city services and applications facilitate
these improvements, creating new value from existing infrastructure,
and generating new revenue streams and operational efficiencies to save
costs for governments and citizens. To begin exploring the concept of
smart cities as an innovation, it is important to understand its key elements (Law and Lynch, 2019, Kumar and Dahiya, 2017). The smart city
is a concept that has been developed in three main domains: academic,
industrial, and governmental. Many literatures take a holistic and review approach, defining "smart" to include a wide range of characteristics such as self-configuration, self-repair, self-protection, and
self-optimization, with an emphasis on knowledge and information
development (Batty, 2018). The industrial literature focuses on business
and industrial tools, defining "smart" as smart services and products, AI,
and thinking devices. Government documents, aimed at managing
urban development, interpret "smart" in connection with the urban
planning theory of smart growth, with an emphasis on administrative
and financial aspects of the smart city and environmental goals such as
greenhouse gas emissions (Law and Lynch, 2019, Kumar and Dahiya,
2017, Batty, 2018, Riffat, Powell, and Aydin, 2016). Despite the diversity in the definitions, the use of technology and social innovation is
the primary issue in the concept of a smart city. A smart city is a city that
implements improvements in six key areas such as smart people, smart
mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart economy, and smart
environment (Law and Lynch, 2019, Kumar and Dahiya, 2017, Batty,
2018, Riffat, Powell, and Aydin, 2016, Sallis et al., 2016).
2.6. Technology and social development for sustainable urban
transformation
The concept of a smart city is characterized by its objectives, which
include enhancing efficiency, sustainability, equity, and livability.
Smart cities are viewed as a complex system that involves multiple
subsystems, where the coordinated functioning of these subsystems
leads to intelligent behavior. The primary aim of smart city models is to
manage the complexity of cities and improve the quality of life of urban
populations by mitigating the negative impacts of global urbanization
(Hagen and Robertson, 2010, Jarrahi and Sawyer, 2013, Li, 2010,
Leonardi, Huysman, and Steinfield, 2013, Bacigalupe, 2011, Guinan,
Parise, and Rollag, 2014, Gaisina et al., 2015, Moos, 2009, Leibetseder,
2011). Smart cities offer various services across essential urban functions, with different projects worldwide targeting specific goals such as
reducing pollution, achieving energy efficiency, promoting high-quality
living environments, and fostering economic growth and social development. While technology is a critical feature of a smart city, social issues cannot be ignored, and people play a crucial role in creating
intelligent cities.
A smart city is multifaceted city, making it challenging to measure its
intelligence due to the diverse administrative, economic, social, and
geographical circumstances of each city. Therefore, it is necessary to
preserve the fundamental structures of the smart city concept while
reconstructing definitions specific to each city based on its priorities and
content. The critical components of the smart city concept include the
use of information and communication technology, the integration of
various systems, stakeholder cooperation, investment in social capital,
independent decision-making, collaborative governance, creativity,
learning and management, and the utilization of various local resources.
2.7. Multifaceted goals for enhanced quality of life and sustainability
Fig. 1 presents an infographic summarizing the multifaceted goals of
smart city projects worldwide, which generally aim to enhance the
quality of life for residents and improve the sustainability, efficiency,
and competitiveness of urban areas. Smart cities utilize advanced
technologies, including IoT, AI, and big data, to collect and analyze
information from various sources to inform decision-making and
enhance urban services. The concept of a smart city encompasses several
objectives, such as promoting wealth, health, and sustainability, as well
as encouraging citizen participation and collaborative methods.
Several researchers have identified various dimensions and characteristics that reflect the complexity of a smart city, including the organic
integration of different systems, such as transportation, energy, education, healthcare, buildings, physical infrastructure, food, water, and
public security, to create a truly smart city (Yusuf, 2005, Golding, 2000,
Chui, Vasant, and Liu, 2019, Van der Meer and Van Winden, 2003, Wu
et al., 2022, Uche et al., 2013, Volkov and Kuzina, 2016, Bicer and
Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019). This integration
is crucial as no system can operate effectively in isolation in a densely
populated urban environment. Other characteristics of a smart city
include the use of digital and electronic technologies to create a cyber,
digital, informational, or knowledge-based city and embedding ICT in
urban infrastructure. Additionally, a smart city aims to foster innovation, learning, and knowledge by guiding the interactions between
technology and people. Beyond these technical aspects, the concept of a
smart city also includes broader concepts such as the smart economy,
which refers to a city’s innovative approach to business, research and
development, and productivity, as well as its role in national and international markets.
2.8. Prioritizing education and citizen participation for quality of life
A smart city requires the inclusion of smart people, who possess high
levels of education, social interactions, cultural awareness, open
thinking, and citizen participation in social life. Additionally, smart
governance is a crucial element of a smart city, emphasizing citizen
participation in decision-making processes and promoting transparency
in governance systems. ICT plays a critical role in enabling citizen
participation by providing access to information and data, leading to a
more efficient governance system by removing communication and
cooperation barriers. ICT also supports the development of smart
transportation systems, which promotes citizen access to public transportation and drives new social attitudes towards the use of vehicles,
enhancing the movement and transportation of people, goods, and vehicles in urban environments. Smart cities prioritize the smart environment through responsive resource management and sustainable city
planning to enhance the natural beauty of the city, reduce pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions, and promote energy reduction through
technological innovations. Additionally, the smart life concept seeks to
enhance the quality of life for citizens by providing safe and healthy
Fig. 1. The goals of building smart city for health environment and economic growth.

living conditions, easy access to healthcare services, electronic health
management, and various social services. The construction of a smart
city requires a strong partnership between the government and the
private sector, with effective communication among different private
sector components being necessary for its implementation. Analyzing
and extracting useful information from smart city and cybersecurity data
is a critical task outsourced by the government to contractors, who
provide expert teams with relevant information to address specific
problems.
Smart city construction involves effective communication between
various sectors, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Urbanization has both positive
and negative effects on the environment.
2.9. Mitigating negative effects of urbanization and quality of life
Urbanization, while less damaging to natural systems, results in
increased greenhouse gas emissions. However, smart city technologies
can alleviate the negative effects of urbanization. As cities become
smarter, there is expected to be a reduction in private cars, with the
utilization of self-driving cars and automation leading to decreased
greenhouse gas production and energy consumption. City administrators must not only focus on technological development but also
encourage a smart city culture. Increasing public awareness of the
benefits of a smart city is essential to encourage participation and ensure
citizens understand the free use of data. Effective cooperation between
private and public sectors, as well as citizens, is crucial for creating a
fully connected smart city that is easily accessible and utilized.
The cooperation between governments, private companies, and citizens is crucial for implementing security measures and policies in smart
cities. The government plays a crucial role in setting and enforcing
policies and regulations for smart city security and privacy protection,
including establishing legal frameworks and standards, providing
funding and support for research and development, and ensuring
adherence to security and privacy guidelines. Private companies are
responsible for developing and implementing smart city systems and
technologies and must incorporate security and privacy considerations
into their product development processes, use secure data collection and
storage practices, and implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Citizens must be aware of the privacy risks associated
with smart city technologies and must play an active role in protecting
their personal data by being informed, exercising their rights, and
reporting suspicious activities. To foster cooperation between these
stakeholders, public-private partnerships can be established, citizen
participation can be encouraged, public awareness campaigns can be
conducted, and accountability mechanisms can be established to hold
private companies responsible for any misuse of personal data and to
ensure citizens have recourse in case of privacy violations. By working
together, smart cities can be developed and implemented in a way that
ensures the safety and security of personal data while leveraging the
benefits of data-driven technologies.
Innovative collaboration methods can enhance citizens’ commitment
to smart city projects (Sallis et al., 2016, Jameson, 2003, Brook, 2013,
Ackerman et al., 2014, Bughin, Byers, and Chui, 2011, Hagen and
Robertson, 2010, Jarrahi and Sawyer, 2013, Li, 2010). Transparency
and free access to data should be provided via websites and applications,
promoting awareness and understanding of data usage. Smart city applications enable citizens to access a variety of information and perform
tasks such as paying bills, locating public transportation, and monitoring
energy consumption. The primary target of a smart city is to improve the
quality of life for its citizens and promote economic growth. By delivering better services at lower costs and using existing infrastructure,
smart cities enable citizens to discover and create new values, resulting
in new revenue streams and increased operational efficiency, saving
time and energy for both the government and citizens.
3. Development of social technology
3.1. From technology-driven urban areas to economic prosperity
Smart cities have become a topic of significant interest, with
increased attention from the media, technology companies, entrepreneurs, local governments, and civil society. The potential of smart cities
to create technologically advanced, efficient, and smarter urban environments that enhance citizens’ quality of life has been widely
acknowledged. Various governments worldwide have accepted the
concept of smart cities, leading to the development of many conceptual
frameworks (Leonardi, Huysman, and Steinfield, 2013, Bacigalupe,
2011, Guinan, Parise, and Rollag, 2014, Gaisina et al., 2015, Moos,
2009, Leibetseder, 2011, Fawcett et al., 1984). The acceptance of cities
of technology and development seems to have gone through three
stages, with the initial stage emphasizing the connection between
corporate technology and urban governance. Other companies have also
recognized the potential of technology in transforming cities into
advanced, efficient, and secure urban spaces for innovators. Smart cities’
technology-oriented vision creates an environment that appeals to urban
technology innovators and plays a vital role in job growth and economic
prosperity in cities, leading to increased competition among cities to
become more advanced and sophisticated. The first generation of smart
cities is characterized by the adoption of technology with minimal
impact on citizens’ quality of life, similar to queuing for the latest Apple
Fig. 2. Components of smart city as a concept refers to the use of advanced technology and data analytics to improve the quality of life.

product without knowing how to use it. Private sector technology
companies such as Living Plan IT and Cisco are developing visions for
future cities. The second generation of smart cities is characterized by
the active utilization of technology for urban governance, led by city
governments rather than technology providers (Pelikan, 2003, McCormick and Scrimshaw, 2001, Webb and Cox, 2004, Mumtaz, 2000, Selwyn et al., 2003, Kirschner and Selinger, 2003, Giannopoulos, 2004).
3.2. The evolution of smart cities and innovations in urban governance
In the second generation of smart cities, mayors and city managers
play a crucial role in guiding cities towards a future that utilizes smart
and other city-related technologies in enhancing the quality of life. The
mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, commissioned IBM to create a sensor
network that reduced landslide risks in favelas, which was connected to
a 21st-century operations center providing online surveillance for crime
detection and prevention and integrated with other smart emergency
services. Fast Company has ranked many pioneering smart cities among
the top in the world, most of which belong to the second generation,
such as Barcelona, which has implemented numerous smart city-related
programs, including WIFI in public spaces and transportation, smart
lighting, and improving electric vehicle charging infrastructure (Yusuf,
2005, Golding, 2000, Chui, Vasant, and Liu, 2019, Van der Meer and
Van Winden, 2003, Wu et al., 2022). The third generation of smart cities
emphasizes citizen participation, which departs from the
technology-centric approach of the first generation and the
technology-enabled urban governance approach of the second generation. Pioneering smart cities have leveraged participatory models to
inform future generations of smart cities. Vienna, a leading smart city,
engages citizens as investors in local solar power plants to achieve the
city’s clean energy goals by 2050 through citizen participation. Additionally, Vienna places a high emphasis on citizen involvement in
addressing affordable housing and gender equality issues. In Vancouver,
a co-creation program involving thirty thousand citizens led to the
development of an innovative strategy to become the greenest city by
2020. Barcelona also recently concluded the Open Challenge, an innovation project that solicited ideas from citizens and innovators through
the city-mart platform on six key challenges (Chui, Vasant, and Liu,
2019, Van der Meer and Van Winden, 2003, Wu et al., 2022, Uche et al.,
2013, Volkov and Kuzina, 2016).
3.3. From bottom-up urban planning to citizen co-creation
Medellin, a pioneering city in Latin America, serves as an important
example of a third-generation smart city that prioritizes issues such as
equality and social participation through bottom-up urban planning.
The city has undergone significant urban reconstruction, including the
construction of cable cars, escalators, and schools equipped with new
technologies, as well as the development of an innovation district, to
attract and retain entrepreneurial talent. While certain large, venturebacked companies may not align with the values of third-generation
smart cities, initiatives such as tool-sharing platforms and shared bicycles have the potential to reduce resource consumption and improve
the quality of life for city residents. Some cities may progress through all
stages of smart city development, while others may remain in a single
stage. Kansas City has moved from the first generation of smart cities to
the third through a partnership with Google that has enabled the city to
leverage its infrastructure for citizen co-creation and entrepreneurship.
However, cities focused primarily on second-generation smart cities,
such as Singapore, may struggle to adopt more democratic approaches
that prioritize citizen participation. To provide the best opportunities for
the future of cities, city managers should invest in digital infrastructure
while promoting citizen and urban entrepreneurship co-creation. As
companies embrace open-source innovation, cities must also embrace
the innovation ecosystem and provide support for innovation to thrive.
4. Security and privacy of citizens
4.1. Strategies for ensuring security in smart cities
With the ever-increasing usage of the Internet, communication patterns among humans have undergone significant transformations. This
has resulted in the discovery of a novel and intriguing approach to
managing and controlling objects by leveraging the Internet and a
centralized server, which enables individuals to monitor and control
surrounding objects in real-time (Van der Meer and Van Winden, 2003,
Wu et al., 2022, Uche et al., 2013, Volkov and Kuzina, 2016, Bicer and
Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019, Rose et al., 2013).
Establishing robust security protocols necessitates a sophisticated and
advanced management system. To illustrate, consider a public transportation system, a city’s traffic system, or its street lighting system. In
such cases, large volumes of data must first be collected, processed, and
then communicated to operators in the form of commands (Volkov and
Kuzina, 2016, Bicer and Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander,
2019, Rose et al., 2013, Ding et al., 2019). Thus, safeguarding this information from cyber-attacks is of paramount importance. With the
abundance of information and the extensive use of the Internet, the
susceptibility of smart cities to cyber-attacks is a pertinent question. City
officials should not overlook the importance of cyber-security in smart
cities, as it is one of the fundamental challenges associated with the
concept (Uche et al., 2013, Volkov and Kuzina, 2016). Weak
cyber-security can enable hackers and cyber-criminals to infiltrate the
electronic devices that are connected to the Internet and the infrastructure of a smart city, and potentially wreak havoc in the city.
Therefore, the security of this data is of immense value. Cyber-attacks
can pose a severe threat to cities, particularly when the IoTs is
involved. This can create an intricate and fragile environment, which
necessitates comprehensive protection (Bicer and Dincer, 2018). The
smart city movement, the establishment of smart buildings, efficient
waste collection methods, digitized administrative tasks, high-speed
internet accessibility, widespread use of electronic devices and smartphones, ride-sharing services, intelligent traffic systems, urban planning, citizen education and participation, smart parking, electric public
transportation fleets, and similar endeavors have proven to be influential factors (Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019). The incorporation
of such smart technologies and services aims to enhance the quality of
life for humans, which comprises various dimensions including the sense
of security in people daily lives. Thus, individuals must employ strategies to ensure their security in smart buildings and cities. Commonly,
systems such as autonomous vehicles, train control systems, smart
transportation systems, power supply systems, electricity distribution
systems, smart measuring systems, and water supply systems are prone
to cyber-attacks or system disruptions (Rose et al., 2013, Ding et al.,
2019, Hefnawy, Bouras, and Cherifi, 2016, Kumar, 2020, Marrone and
Hammerle, 2018).
4.2. Role of cybersecurity in the development of smart cities
Disconnecting from the internet is not a viable solution, as the advantages of the internet are too significant to ignore, despite the associated risks. A possible approach to minimizing security issues in future
smart city initiatives is to consider cybersecurity concerns during the
design and architecture stages. Security concerns should be prioritized
in the development and implementation of smart city initiatives (Volkov and Kuzina, 2016). The long-term objective of a smart city is to
enhance the quality of services provided to citizens and ultimately
improve their quality of life, facilitated by the development and
expansion of ICT (Rose et al., 2013). ICT is defined as an umbrella term
encompassing all advanced technologies, communication methods, and
data transmission in communication systems. In cities that are at risk
and difficult to live in, infrastructure has been developed over several
years to eliminate limitations in terms of scalability, environment, and
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
8
security while supporting population growth (Ding et al., 2019). However, urban areas currently face complex economic and environmental
crises, presenting both benefits and challenges to this urban transformation. While a smart city offers benefits such as virtual space services that support citizens with timely and high-quality information,
responsive transportation, interactive communication with authorities,
and emergency response systems that can predict and handle disasters,
among others, it also presents challenges. The economy may face pressure and energy consumption may increase exponentially in smart cities.
Educational and healthcare systems will require new approaches. Also,
public security will face further challenges and there is a high potential
for future cyberattacks against cities (Bicer and Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨
Romare, and Tivander, 2019, Rose et al., 2013, Ding et al., 2019, Hefnawy, Bouras, and Cherifi, 2016, Kumar, 2020, Marrone and Hammerle, 2018). This situation could lead to further environmental
destruction if innovative solutions are not adopted. It is necessary to
reconsider resource access models, transportation, waste management,
and energy management to address urban issues (Hefnawy, Bouras, and
Cherifi, 2016). An innovative, intelligent, cost-effective, and scalable
solutions are required. Six main components underpin most smart city
models are government, economy, mobility, environment, living, and
people. All of these components play a crucial role in helping a smart
city achieve numerous benefits (Kumar, 2020, Marrone and Hammerle,
2018, Skouby et al., 2014, Martínez-Ballest´e, P´erez-Martínez, and Solanas, 2013, Mora et al., 2018, Bowser et al., 2017). As previously noted,
a smart city offers numerous solutions to address urban development
and management challenges. However, the successful implementation
of smart services is contingent on the use of ICT as a crucial component
(Bicer and Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019, Rose
et al., 2013). While the integration of ICT presents opportunities, it also
introduces risks and challenges to urban infrastructure. The citizens are
increasingly accessing online services, such as emails and online
banking, via insecure WIFI networks, which exposes them to a variety of
cyber-attacks, including man-in-the-middle (MITM) and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Additionally, new critical infrastructures of cities are
vulnerable to attacks, which can disrupt essential services to urban areas
and industrial sites (Ding et al., 2019, Hefnawy, Bouras, and Cherifi,
2016). As a result, cybersecurity has become one of the primary features
used to categorize secure cities worldwide. The SCI is a widely used tool
that employs over 40 quantitative and qualitative indicators based on
four categories, including digital security, health security, infrastructure
security, and personal security. The collection and utilization of personal data in smart cities may pose various privacy risks for individuals,
including surveillance and tracking through technologies like CCTV
cameras and location-based services, data breaches, a lack of transparency and consent, and discrimination and bias in AI algorithms.
These risks can significantly impact individuals by compromising their
privacy, leading to discrimination and possible harm from data
breaches. To mitigate these risks, several measures can be taken, such as
implementing robust data protection policies, empowering individuals
by providing control over their personal data, incorporating
privacy-by-design principles into smart city system development,
increasing transparency and awareness of data collection and usage, and
developing ethical AI frameworks to address potential bias and
discrimination. By implementing these measures, smart cities can
leverage data-driven technologies while safeguarding individuals’ privacy rights.
To maintain security standards, real-time monitoring and data
acquisition systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) platforms, should be updated to address vulnerabilities and
potential infiltration and attacks (Ding et al., 2019, Hefnawy, Bouras,
and Cherifi, 2016, Kumar, 2020). In the e-government section, system
processes are implemented using electronic media. E-government enables citizens to perform their civic and social responsibilities through
web portals. The primary objectives of e-government services include
providing access to all informational services through official
government websites, efficient coordination across government
agencies, flexible communication methods for citizens, and efficient
service delivery (Marrone and Hammerle, 2018).
The healthcare sector can benefit from internet-connected smart
devices, particularly in smart cities, to deliver useful services (Skouby
et al., 2014, Martínez-Ballest´e, P´erez-Martínez, and Solanas, 2013). The
result of healthcare services is to improve the health of individuals by
providing access to a diverse range of healthcare facilities. Public health
professionals often require access to patients’ medical records through
connected devices anytime and anywhere, particularly in circumstances
where physical presence is unfeasible or in times of unpredictable disasters (Mora et al., 2018, Bowser et al., 2017).
4.3. Role of cybersecurity and E-government in the development of smart
cities
Remote healthcare delivery can be made possible using smart devices, which are wirelessly connected to health centers and a data analytics system. Nonetheless, there are numerous obstacles in
implementing healthcare services, including coordination among
healthcare providers, insurance rights in case of errors or mistakes, high
energy consumption by new healthcare devices, communication between hospitals requiring common languages or new protocols, highquality compatible systems, and standardization of processes
(Martínez-Ballest´e, P´erez-Martínez, and Solanas, 2013, Mora et al.,
2018, Bowser et al., 2017, Bowser et al., 2014). In the development of
new architectures, ensuring safety and reliability through effective and
reliable security techniques is of utmost importance. Furthermore, it is
imperative to establish an ethical framework that emphasizes the benefits of the internet for humanity. This can incentivize companies to
produce intelligent and pervasive products, mitigate new issues, and
ensure global connectivity, cyber security is a viable solution to achieve
this goal (Maaß, 2011, Parkin and Paul, 2011). In recent decades, cyber
security has evolved to become a critical component of data protection.
Initially, cities sought to fortify their systems. However, the cloud is now
considered a safer option due to the presence of 24/7 security experts
who possess advanced skills in monitoring, identifying, and preventing
attacks (Calzada, 2022). The integration of services has resulted in an
increased number of vulnerabilities created by data exchanges, making
data security more important than ever. Over the years, the frequency of
threats to privacy and cyber-attacks has steadily increased, leading to a
significant rise in cyber-attacks on data and physical assets (Hallinan,
Friedewald, and McCarthy, 2012). However, for smart cities to thrive,
this connection must be executed safely. Smart cities’ developers and
planners face a critical challenge in cybersecurity, as the integrated
environment presents inherent risks (Maaß, 2011, Parkin and Paul,
2011, Calzada, 2022). Although the cybersecurity industry comprehensively understands the measurement and mitigation of cyber attacks’
impact on non-smart city infrastructures, knowledge about attacks on
smart cities’ potential impact is limited. An attack on smart city infrastructure can result in cascading effects that impact other parts of the
city, country, or beyond, with non-linear effects often exceeding the
initial direct damage. Such attacks may reveal hidden dependencies
between different components of the city, disrupting systems believed to
be separate from the point of impact (Hallinan, Friedewald, and
McCarthy, 2012). When creating these highly interconnected environments, flexibility is a fundamental concept that must be considered.
Urban planning should use resilience as a cornerstone to enhance
resilience and maintain flexibility for future advancements (Reidenberg, 2014). The cost of not investing in cybersecurity can be much
higher than investing, with potential damages reaching billions of euros.
City leaders recognize the impact of cyber incidents, extending beyond
data loss to financial losses, damage to reputation, decreased social
trust, and disruption to critical city services and infrastructure (Hiller
and B´elanger, 2001). The rapid evolution of technical innovation in
smart city programs necessitates the awareness of privacy, data
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
9
protection, and digital infrastructure flexibility for efficient city operations and resident safety. The lack of privacy awareness can lead to an
increase in distrust and vulnerability to cyber-attacks (Igo, 2018).
However, in many cities, only high-level managers and officials possess
a high level of cybersecurity awareness, which creates a significant risk
of cyber-attacks and an inability to cope with them among the majority
of people. The mutual nature of smart cities requires stronger public
awareness than security frameworks in smart infrastructures (Bicer and
Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019, Rose et al., 2013).
4.4. Risk reduction and security in the era of deepfakes and cyberattacks
Forrester revealed that deepfake-based attacks using AI that produce
convincing audio and video at a fraction of the production cost should be
expected. To reduce the risk, information technology departments must
invest more in educational and awareness programs (Brook, 2013,
Ackerman et al., 2014, Bughin, Byers, and Chui, 2011, Hagen and
Robertson, 2010). The absence of independent cybersecurity units and
departments in a connected city can act as a barrier to achieving higher
levels of cyber stability and privacy awareness. Despite the inclusion of
high-volume data management and exchange in many smart city plans,
the responsibility for securing these digital operations usually lies with
local government and municipal information technology departments,
which can limit the effectiveness of cyber risk management within the
city (Bowser et al., 2017, Bowser et al., 2014, Maaß, 2011). Moreover,
increasing connectivity requires a better risk response system to maintain digital confidentiality and prompt event management, both of
which are vital elements in the smart city ecosystem. Service disruptions
can be harmful and even life-threatening in some cases; therefore,
effective and comprehensive awareness-raising programs are necessary
to ensure the success of smart city initiatives. Foundational principles
such as a zero-trust model, transparency and privacy, regulations and
compliance, granular segmentation, risk-based identity, and flexibility
are crucial to achieving this objective (Bowser et al., 2014, Maaß, 2011,
Parkin and Paul, 2011, Calzada, 2022, Hallinan, Friedewald, and
McCarthy, 2012, Reidenberg, 2014, Hiller and B´elanger, 2001). As cities
strive towards cybersecurity, they must focus on three major objectives
such as national management of smart cities that combines advanced
infrastructure with dense and high-speed connections, provision of new
economic opportunities and urban life facilities, and reduction of potential disruption risks (Dameri, 2017, Nam and Pardo, 2011, Eremia,
Toma, and Sanduleac, 2017, Alawadhi et al., 2012, Zubizarreta, Seravalli, and Arrizabalaga, 2016). This risk reduction requires a professional, systematic, and long-term approach to security, which the
government can achieve by developing regular policies, guidelines, and
cybersecurity tools to protect critical infrastructures. Professionals
responsible for securing smart cities are concerned with the possibility of
disruptions, as these cities function as defensive ecosystems. Smart city
construction, however, presents a double-edged sword with both risks
and defensive and self-healing properties (Hallinan, Friedewald, and
McCarthy, 2012, Reidenberg, 2014). While dense connections may
enable destructive agents to move quickly, defensive countermeasures
can operate at the same speed and leverage insights and views provided
by numerous individuals and devices connected to the smart city (Hiller
and B´elanger, 2001, Igo, 2018, Chatterjee, Kumar Kar, and Gupta, 2018,
van de Pas and van Bussel, 2015, Craigen, Diakun-Thibault, and Purse,
2014).
4.5. Strategies for governance, data management, and citizen
empowerment
A smart city should be designed to encourage the organic and digital
organization and empowerment of its inhabitants for security, as it is a
living organism. Restarting with stability that is designed with cyber
resilience in mind is crucial. Although the concept of sustainability is
well-understood in protecting critical infrastructures, it comes at a cost.
Sustainable infrastructures and technologies must have the ability to
adapt to changing circumstances and provide the necessary tools for
identifying, protecting against, detecting, and responding to threats
(Selwyn et al., 2003, Kirschner and Selinger, 2003, Giannopoulos, 2004,
Yusuf, 2005, Golding, 2000, Chui, Vasant, and Liu, 2019). To achieve
three objectives, cities must consider several factors, including synchronization with a cyber strategy to enable flexibility, governance that
is transparent with cyber and data accountability, and the creation of an
innovative and collaborative culture. Cities need to define a precise
cyber security strategy that aligns with their broader smart city strategy
and reduces risks resulting from continuous convergence, collaboration,
and interoperability of city systems and processes (Van der Meer and
Van Winden, 2003). In addition, cities should regularly and comprehensively evaluate their cyber data, systems, and assets to identify,
assess, and mitigate risks in their technology processes, policies, and
solutions. Moreover, cities should adhere to the principles of cyber security by designing and formalizing a governance approach to data,
assets, infrastructure, and other technology components, defining a
comprehensive governance model that outlines responsibilities and
roles for each vital component in the smart city ecosystem (Gaisina et al.,
2015, Moos, 2009, Leibetseder, 2011). Data management, including
data sharing and privacy protection policies, data analytics skills, and
revenue models that facilitate the sourcing and use of city data, is a
critical aspect of governance (Bicer and Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare,
and Tivander, 2019, Rose et al., 2013, Ding et al., 2019, Hefnawy,
Bouras, and Cherifi, 2016). To address the persistent cyber skills gap,
cities must be proactive and innovative in their approaches, utilizing
non-traditional methods such as crowdsourcing, prizes, and competitions to discover and cultivate cyber talents. Furthermore, cities must
develop new skills and competencies at various levels of their ecosystems to keep up with the demands of a smart city, and can also enhance
their existing capabilities by forming strategic partnerships and
outsourcing agreements with service providers (Uche et al., 2013). In
addition to these measures, regulatory frameworks must be harmonized
and continuously synchronized with policies, legislation, and technology to strike a balance between protection, privacy, transparency, and
profitability. In the management of cybersecurity for smart cities, it is
essential to adopt a specific tool capable of managing the complex regulatory framework and automating the collection process to comply
with a wide range of regulations (Volkov and Kuzina, 2016). This tool
must provide daily support to the Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO) and serve as a platform to consolidate disparate smart systems
into a comprehensive view of total security. This unified cyber risk
management program must span the entire life cycle of the smart
ecosystem, including government, vendors and third parties, lawmakers, security organizations, and citizens, and be developed with a
focus on security and stability (Ding et al., 2019). Enhancing cyber city’s
privacy through public events: The inhabitants are crucial stakeholders
in securing a cyber city. To foster trust in current initiatives and promote
responsible behavior in data sharing and risk management, it is necessary to have informed citizens (Hefnawy, Bouras, and Cherifi, 2016).
Japan has been actively working on improving its cybersecurity measures since the announcement of the 2020 Olympic Games, with a focus
on public-private partnerships, workforce development, cybersecurity
exercises, and innovation. Singapore has implemented a comprehensive
cybersecurity strategy that includes a dedicated government agency, the
Cyber Security Agency (CSA), and the Personal Data Protection Act
(PDPA) to protect citizens’ personal data. Barcelona has implemented
the "Decidim" platform, a participatory democracy platform that incorporates privacy-by-design principles and established a privacy and
data protection office to oversee data protection efforts.
4.6. Case studies from Tokyo and Toronto
Tokyo has also invested in digital security and has been recognized as
one of the world’s top cities in terms of accessibility and security (Bicer
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
10
and Dincer, 2018, Nordelof, ¨ Romare, and Tivander, 2019, Rose et al.,
2013, Ding et al., 2019, Hefnawy, Bouras, and Cherifi, 2016). Japan’s
efforts in cybersecurity show a commitment to promoting innovation
and economic growth while ensuring the safety and security of its citizens and visitors. The city of Toronto has prioritized the development of
its cybersecurity in response to threats and attacks, following a recommendation from the Auditor General (Riffat, Powell, and Aydin, 2016,
Sallis et al., 2016, Jameson, 2003). Presently, the city employs network
protection technology and cybersecurity measures to safeguard its
infrastructure and assets. A cybersecurity program was established by
the city in 2017, which underwent review and expansion in 2019
(Morozov and Bria, 2018, Angelidou, 2017, Komninos, 2007). To
manage cyber risks and enhance existing cyber defense, the city has
appointed a CISO who is responsible for developing a cybersecurity
strategy. Canada is currently experiencing a dearth of cybersecurity
professionals, and to address this issue, the University of Toronto has
collaborated with five other Canadian universities to explore the feasibility of creating a cybersecurity operations center for higher education
in Canada (Kim, Ramos, and Mohammed, 2017, Kirimtat et al., 2020,
Al-Hader et al., 2009, Cardullo, Di Feliciantonio, and Kitchin, 2019,
Morozov and Bria, 2018). The city of Toronto also hosts additional
initiatives such as Catalyst Cyber Accelerator to capitalize on the
cybersecurity ecosystem and cultivate expertise. Market conditions, and
financial resources, Toronto is well-positioned to become a global leader
in cybersecurity, both independently and as part of the Ontario Global
Security Hub. Toronto ranked sixth on the Economist SCI in 2019 (Chui,
Vasant, and Liu, 2019). As the world becomes more interconnected, the
importance of privacy has become increasingly prominent. The initial
excitement surrounding the concept of a smart city was met with strong
backlash from citizens due to privacy concerns, resulting in the termination of projects such as the Alphabet Sidewalk Lab and the transformation of Toronto’s waterfront in 2020. Despite attractive ideas for
smart buildings, self-driving vehicles, and advanced wooden towers
aimed at making housing more affordable, the project failed to persuade
the public of the benefits of sensors and surveillance, instead creating
fear and suspicion regarding privacy and surveillance (Uche et al., 2013,
Volkov and Kuzina, 2016, Bicer and Dincer, 2018). While the ultimate
goal was to provide benefits to the public, the inability to establish trust
and the lack of transparency were cited as reasons for the project’s
abandonment, highlighting the need for local authorities to strike a
balance when implementing smart city projects. Toronto has presented a
new vision for the area to replace the Sidewalk Lab project, emphasizing
initiatives driven by citizens and the community (Skouby et al., 2014).
5. Supervision and regulation with the support of AI
5.1. Impact of AI on society: debates on privacy, economy, and security
The impact of AI on society is subject to debate, with privacy being
the primary concern (Martínez-Ballest´e, P´erez-Martínez, and Solanas,
2013, Mora et al., 2018, Bowser et al., 2017). Other important issues
include the effects of AI on the economy and future jobs. AI’s use in
predictive surveillance cameras and policing is scrutinized from social,
ethical, and geopolitical perspectives. It is noteworthy that the value of
technology hinges on its use; technologies are neither good nor bad. It is
humans who establish trust, and then technology is utilized in that same
setting (Bowser et al., 2014). Recently, the use of AI in security has
increased, leading to innovative services in the police force. Communication between citizens and police has improved with AI, building
trust between the two parties (Maaß, 2011). Furthermore, the prospect
of using and developing AI-based image-processing solutions has grown.
A Deloitte report from 2018 demonstrates a 30-40% decrease in urban
crime and a 20-35% reduction in emergency response times due to AI’s
use (Parkin and Paul, 2011). The report also suggests that cities are
investing in real-time crime detection, population management, and
gunshot detection (Calzada, 2022). The concept of surveillance and the
use of surveillance cameras is not novel. However, cities are now seeking
predictive crime capabilities by analyzing surveillance data through AI
to enhance security (Hallinan, Friedewald, and McCarthy, 2012, Reidenberg, 2014). Although cities have been recording images for surveillance purposes, AI can enable faster image analysis and processing,
facilitating the analysis of voluminous data for crime detection, crime
pattern recognition, and the correlation between events that lead to
crime (Hiller and B´elanger, 2001). The primary objective of this
approach is to create a security system capable of detecting terrorist
networks, crimes, and suspicious activities while assisting in creating a
more efficient judicial system. Furthermore, cities are also investigating
the utilization of AI and surveillance cameras for other purposes (Igo,
2018).
5.2. AI surveillance in urban settings: balancing security and privacy
Paris is leveraging AI and cameras in its metro system to monitor
citizens wearing masks, not for punishing them but for predicting the
spread of COVID-19. Although facial recognition by AI raises ethical
concerns, pursuing these objectives while respecting personal privacy
and citizens’ freedom remains an open question. Experts assert that
developing an AI system that is ethical and regulatory for all applications is nearly impossible due to the complexity of applications (Chatterjee, Kumar Kar, and Gupta, 2018, van de Pas and van Bussel, 2015).
Therefore, all AI uses and advancements in surveillance cameras must be
reviewed and discussed from an ethical and legislative perspective, even
if their added value is significant.
Ethical considerations are of utmost importance in smart city
research, given the significant implications of the large-scale data
collection and analysis involved. These considerations include privacy,
security, social equity, and environmental impact. Researchers must
ensure that their work upholds ethical principles and protects the rights
and well-being of citizens. Specifically, they should prioritize privacy by
anonymizing collected data and obtaining informed consent from participants. Security should also be a top concern, and researchers should
implement appropriate measures, such as encryption and access controls, to prevent unauthorized access. Social equity is another crucial
factor, and researchers should ensure that their work does not contribute
to or worsen social inequalities. Finally, researchers must consider the
environmental impact of smart city initiatives and explore ways to
mitigate any adverse effects. By prioritizing ethical considerations, researchers can contribute to the development of smart cities that are
equitable, sustainable, and beneficial for all citizens. Predictive policing
through AI has been highly controversial in Western countries to the
extent of being banned in some US cities. However, Asia has implemented this concept as revealed by a study conducted by Deloitte, which
demonstrates a significant difference (Craigen, Diakun-Thibault, and
Purse, 2014). The integration of AI in urban surveillance systems has the
potential to benefit cities and their citizens. The primary objective is to
establish safer cities with lower crime rates by employing predictive
policing techniques to prevent crime. It is widely accepted that prevention is better than cure, and this approach is particularly effective in
enhancing the safety of both the city and its inhabitants (Carley, 2020,
Elmaghraby and Losavio, 2014). Vancouver’s police department in
Canada has implemented predictive models to identify areas with a high
risk of crime and deployed police forces to those areas, preventing crime
from happening. The second objective is to provide support for law
enforcement and other organizations as police stations often face staff
shortages, making it difficult to manage densely populated areas (Baig
et al., 2017). AI-based resources can aid law enforcement agencies in
monitoring all environments and areas at a lower cost without human
intervention. Moreover, AI can be utilized in surveillance cameras to
identify behaviors that pose a risk to citizens’ health and the environment, thereby enabling local governments and municipalities to take
necessary precautions (AlDairi, 2017). The third target is to establish an
integrated relationship among various urban sectors in cities where the
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
11
police, firefighting, and emergency services employ distinct communication systems. By leveraging AI, organizations that need to intervene
can quickly identify the affected area through image analysis and
receive real-time notifications. Such a unified communication system
would lead to a reduction in response time and mitigate further damage
and losses (Chen, Wawrzynski, and Lv, 2021). The fourth objective is to
safeguard the lives of officers and security guards. Emerging technologies, such as AI and smart robots, can aid in predicting and preventing
crime and thus protect the lives of officers. The fifth objective is to lower
medical and insurance expenses, which are typically higher in high-risk
cities where casualties are also more prevalent (Efthymiopoulos, 2016).
Using predictive monitoring, human losses can be averted, and medical
and health insurance costs can be reduced. Despite the benefits of
incorporating AI into surveillance systems, the most significant challenge is balancing security interests with citizens’ civil liberties (Young,
Thompson, and Taylor, 1991). The subject lacks universal support due
to concerns over privacy and freedom. In 2020, predictive police
methods were banned in Santa Cruz and New York. Hence, cities must
enact strong laws to safeguard their citizens’ data, and the use of AI in
surveillance systems must be transparent and founded on privacy and
freedom principles (Carley, 2020, Elmaghraby and Losavio, 2014, Baig
et al., 2017). It is imperative to identify and address shortcomings and
necessary modifications in-laws about the issue at hand. The laws should
ensure the protection of citizens’ civil liberties to foster a trustworthy
environment for implementing such concepts (Young, Thompson, and
Taylor, 1991, Hahn, Robert, and Jezior, 1999).
5.3. Ethical considerations and AI in security and surveillance systems
The formation of a review committee is necessary to scrutinize
various applications from ethical and civil liberties perspectives. The
committee members should comprise experts in policy-making, citizen
representatives, technical experts, and social representatives. Ethical
considerations in the use of AI in surveillance and security systems
should encompass three areas: justice, equality, and inclusivity (Maaß,
2011). To prevent instances of discrimination in algorithms, it is crucial
to establish mechanisms for reviewing and rendering AI algorithms
transparent. AI’s use in criminal detection endeavors to eliminate bias in
judgments; hence, successful implementation necessitates a system that
explicates the algorithms (Parkin and Paul, 2011, Calzada, 2022, Hallinan, Friedewald, and McCarthy, 2012). Code developers or authors
may have introduced bias, and using personal data poses significant
challenges to trust, citizenship, and personal rights. Therefore, it is
recommended that priority be given to using environmental data for
comparison, as using personal data presents ethical dilemmas. Cities
should primarily rely on environmental data collected through sensors
and IoT devices, which does not necessitate anonymization procedures
(Chen, Wawrzynski, and Lv, 2021). The use of IoT devices for collecting
environmental data is simpler and does not entail restrictions related to
personal data. To effectively utilize AI systems in security matters, it is
crucial to establish trust between law enforcement officials and citizens.
This requires close collaboration between the two parties (Young,
Thompson, and Taylor, 1991, Hahn, Robert, and Jezior, 1999, Raper,
Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos, 2007, Lai, Yeung and Celi, Holguín-Veras
et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2002, Giannopoulos, 1989). The trust serves as a
foundational element for the deployment of AI systems. Therefore, it is
recommended that cities take measures to enhance trust by involving
citizens in the process of developing and legislating these systems. The
perceptions of the public regarding data collection and processing are
particularly important. Furthermore, to fully harness the potential of AI
in the judicial system, urban governments must incorporate organizational culture with digital changes. This entails a fundamental shift in
the way organizations operate to align with technological advancements
(Hahn, Robert, and Jezior, 1999, Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos,
2007). Singapore has emerged as a leading nation in the adoption of AI
for security and monitoring purposes. Currently, AI is utilized in various
systems across Singapore, including the police force, border surveillance, and urban security. The Singapore Civil Defense Force (SCDF) has
integrated drones into its operations, including fire tracking, surveillance, and search and rescue missions. Additionally, the Ministry of
Home Affairs employs drones for aerial monitoring of public events,
such as the New Year’s Eve celebration (Lai, Yeung and Celi).
5.4. AI applications in security and crime prevention
To further improve information collection, the Singapore Police
Force (SPF) plans to incorporate wearable technologies, such as smart
glasses with video feeds, which are expected to perform real-time video
analysis, including facial recognition (Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos,
2007, Lai, Yeung and Celi). Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Singaporean government has implemented various
AI-powered initiatives, such as the Vigilant Gantry system, which
automatically displays people’s temperatures using a camera and thermal scanner. Additionally, the government has increased the number of
available thermal scanners to enhance the speed of contactless scanning
(Holguín-Veras et al., 2020). Within Singapore’s national AI strategy,
consisting of five key areas: transportation, smart cities, healthcare,
education, safety, and security, the government aims to position
Singapore as a leading developer and implementer of scalable and impactful AI solutions by 2030. As part of this vision, the government has
proposed two AI-based security improvement projects (Bowser et al.,
2014, Maaß, 2011, Parkin and Paul, 2011, Calzada, 2022). Firstly, a
drowning detection system utilizing computer vision technology in 27
swimming pools will be implemented by 2021. Secondly, an AI-assisted
border clearance operation aimed at increasing security screening by
evaluating passengers’ risk profiles before arriving at inspection stations
(Calzada, 2022, Hallinan, Friedewald, and McCarthy, 2012, Reidenberg, 2014, Hiller and B´elanger, 2001). These projects will rely on
various AI technologies such as machine learning, computer vision,
cognitive systems, and AI (Chui, Vasant, and Liu, 2019, Van der Meer
and Van Winden, 2003, Wu et al., 2022, Uche et al., 2013, Volkov and
Kuzina, 2016, Bicer and Dincer, 2018). The AI system is capable of
identifying patterns and connections among multiple crimes and predicting the next move of a criminal, based on data related to each crime.
The deep learning algorithm of the system enables real-time training and
access to police statistics and other relevant crime details, such as time,
location, weather, and geography. Moreover, there are plans to extend
the system’s scope by allowing AI to analyze social media for identifying
specific individuals or areas that may be associated with criminal activity (Hahn, Robert, and Jezior, 1999). This platform is accessible
through smartphones and computer browsers, providing users with a
visual display of safety levels at specific locations and times (Efthymiopoulos, 2016). By making crime data more accessible and transparent, the Crime Radar app has contributed to improving safety for
citizens and has led to a reduction in crime rates by 30 to 40% in the
area.
6. Components in urban operations
6.1. AI and digital platforms: revolutionizing urban operations and
decision-making
Numerous technologies and solutions have played a crucial role in
the creation and development of bustling cities. Currently, AI is
emerging and expanding as an integral part of the functioning systems of
cities (Young, Thompson, and Taylor, 1991). The deployment of machines and devices that continuously work towards accomplishing the
various operations and tasks that are the responsibility of cities is
increasingly becoming more intelligent with the integration of AI
(Hahn, Robert, and Jezior, 1999). The optimization of these operations
by AI would enable not only citizens but also city managers to benefit
from providing services in a new and improved manner. Raper et al.
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
12
(Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos, 2007) predicted that by 2021, at
least 30% of government service interactions would be conducted
through AI (Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos, 2007). However, the
2021 ESI Thought Lab report shows that AI investments are happening
at much higher levels (Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos, 2007, Lai,
Yeung and Celi). Among the 167 cities examined in the report, 66% have
made significant investments in AI. Although chatbots are currently the
most common AI-based solution, cities are expected to be equipped with
a digital platform that will serve as the central and intellectual core of
the city (Holguín-Veras et al., 2020). This platform will analyze all urban
activities and operations and expand the city’s perspective on urban
issues, enable rapid and easy prediction of issues, and help identify
dependencies, providing planners with better decision-making capabilities (Zhou et al., 2002). The integration of new technologies such as 5G
will facilitate the creation of extensively connected cities where the
behavior of citizens can be transformed into stored anonymous data that
can be analyzed using AI. The analysis of this data would help improve
decision-making for the city and its citizens. Deploying an urban platform for managing city operations is considered a viable solution for
cities (Giannopoulos, 1989, Yeh, 1999). Cities are poised to undergo
digital transformation by adopting innovative technologies such as
cloud computing, the IoTs, and digital twins, supported by comprehensive perspectives, proper data management, and infrastructure.
Digital twins are digital versions of a city’s environment and physical
assets, used for urban planning purposes. The digital twins of cities, such
as those of Dublin and Singapore, can provide various benefits such as
simulating natural disasters, predicting and planning responses to them,
and exploring the effects of greenery on pedestrian walkways (Parkinson, Tayler, and Mark, 2007).
6.2. Emergence of digital twins and AI in urban operations and decisionmaking
The concept of digital twins will become a crucial factor for datadriven decision-making, as predicted by the ABI Institute, which projects that the number of digital twins will surpass 500 by 2025 (Mutikanga, Sharma, and Vairavamoorthy, 2011). By leveraging big data
analytics and machine learning, cities can gain a better understanding of
ongoing developments and become better prepared to adapt to a dynamic environment. Urban operations powered by AI gather data from
various sensors and devices, enabling quick and automated identification and rectification of system errors, and preventing potential breakdowns (Medby and Glenn, 2002). Furthermore, cities can continuously
learn and respond to the needs of their stakeholders by regularly
assessing data. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many cities
acknowledged that timely access to data and its analysis is critical for
effective city management. Data collected from connected devices and
AI-driven applications are analyzed and processed, providing relevant
officials with insights into the city’s developments (Yeh, 1999, Parkinson, Tayler, and Mark, 2007, Mutikanga, Sharma, and Vairavamoorthy,
2011, Medby and Glenn, 2002). Fig. 3 shows twelve areas of future cities
that are crucial for creating sustainable, livable, and innovative urban
environments that meet the needs of citizens. These areas are interconnected and require a multidisciplinary approach to achieve success.
By analyzing images from traffic cameras, cities can identify and
penalize high-risk drivers and predict crime hotspots in different areas.
The efficacy of AI-based security measures is evident in a report by smart
city (Freire and Stren, 2001, Zhou, Liu, and Wang, 2012, Tortonesi et al.,
2016, Mohanty, Choppali, and Kougianos, 2016, Burke and Zvarikova,
2021, Carrion, ´ Huerta, and Barzallo, 2018). The municipal services and
AI technology has emerged as a promising technology that can aid in
improving efficiency and automation at scale. Seoul city has implemented smart cameras and image analysis at metro stations to adjust
train speeds in response to the volume of passengers at each station
(Raper, Gartner, Karimi, and Rizos, 2007, Lai, Yeung and Celi, Holguín-Veras et al., 2020). Likewise, Sao ˜ Paulo city utilizes AI and big data
to predict air pollution levels by aggregating data from mobile phones,
air quality, traffic, and pollution sensors, enabling the city to forecast
pollution levels for the next 24 to 48 hours. The use of AI in gathering
feedback from citizens has also proven effective in enhancing the relationship between people and their government (Zhou, Liu, and Wang,
2012). By aggregating data from various sources such as businesses,
citizens, and tourists and analyzing their correlations and effects, city
planners can make more informed decisions and engage in long-term
planning (Tortonesi et al., 2016). The importance of AI-based urban
operations for citizens is further elaborated in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4 provides a more detailed representation of the importance of
AI-based urban operations for citizens, illustrating how the implementation of AI-based systems and technologies can result in numerous
benefits for individuals. These advantages encompass augmented safety
and security, heightened efficiency and productivity, improved environmental sustainability, and an elevated quality of life. AI can be utilized in urban surveillance systems to identify potential security threats
and enable rapid emergency response, thus improving citizen safety.
Additionally, AI-powered transportation systems can optimize traffic
flow, reduce congestion, and minimize travel time for commuters,
resulting in enhanced efficiency and productivity.
6.3. Data governance and AI for transparent and citizen-centered smart
cities
To implement AI, cities must first establish a suitable model for data
governance, which is a critical step. City stakeholders must be aware of
the location and purpose of their data usage, which can increase public
trust in the system (Medby and Glenn, 2002, Freire and Stren, 2001,
Zhou, Liu, and Wang, 2012, Tortonesi et al., 2016, Mohanty, Choppali,
and Kougianos, 2016). Ensuring transparent, timely, and easily accessible data exchange mechanisms, including financial considerations
such as blockchain, is also essential. Without an adequate data management model in place, both public trust in the system and the accuracy
of the data can be severely compromised. Validity of study on smart city
involves ensuring that research methods and findings are relevant,
meaningful, and applicable beyond the smart city study. A valid study
on smart cities would use research methods that can be replicated in
other cities and draw conclusions that can be applied to other urban
contexts. Both accuracy and validity are crucial for ensuring the reliability and credibility of smart cities research. Accurate and valid
Fig. 3. Twelve areas of future of smart and developed cities.
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
13
research findings can inform policy decisions, guide urban planning and
management, and improve the quality of life for citizens. By prioritizing
accuracy and validity in their research, scholars can contribute to the
development of smart cities that are sustainable, livable, and responsive
to the needs of their inhabitants. Raper et al. (Raper, Gartner, Karimi,
and Rizos, 2007) predicts that by 2030, 30% of active companies in the
smart city domain will lose public support and popularity due to the lack
of integrated services and data analysis (Zhou, Liu, and Wang, 2012,
Tortonesi et al., 2016, Mohanty, Choppali, and Kougianos, 2016).
Although utilizing data can improve service provision, protecting privacy remains a significant concern. Cities must safeguard citizens’ data
and reassure them that their data is being used appropriately. To create a
smart city, one crucial aspect is to ensure the existence of standards that
guarantee data exchange and facilitate integration and analysis. By
utilizing APIs for data integration, the effectiveness of smart city platforms can be enhanced, and sub-systems can be put in place to protect
them (Burke and Zvarikova, 2021). One well-known standard that can
be utilized in this area is ISO-37120, which is specific to smart cities.
However, since all AI-based systems rely on algorithms for their performance, it is important to ensure that such algorithms do not cause
increased discrimination in society, such as by unfairly assigning specific groups or ethnicities (Carrion, ´ Huerta, and Barzallo, 2018). To
mitigate this risk, having a diverse team working with data can be
helpful. To enable employees to effectively utilize AI, cities should
provide them with continuous short-term training courses, and curricula
for students should be reviewed to prepare them for future employment
in a world increasingly reliant on AI (Burke and Zvarikova, 2021). The
new approach to designing future cities places citizens, local businesses,
and tourists at the center, with all activities geared towards providing
better services to them. Vienna, Austria became one of the early
adopters to publish its open data policy document and introduce the
Vero City platform at 2011 (Mohanty, Choppali, and Kougianos, 2016,
Burke and Zvarikova, 2021, Carrion, ´ Huerta, and Barzallo, 2018, Burke
and Zvarikova, 2021). To effectively address the challenges posed by
smart city security and privacy, it is crucial to take proactive measures to
anticipate and mitigate potential risks. Such measures may involve
conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential threats and
vulnerabilities, implementing strong security and privacy policies and
procedures, and regularly monitoring and updating systems and
technologies to ensure their ongoing security and compliance with
evolving regulations and standards. Additionally, fostering collaboration and coordination among stakeholders, including governments,
private companies, and citizens, is essential to ensuring that security and
privacy considerations are prioritized throughout the entire system
lifecycle. The proliferation of IoT devices, the use of AI and machine
learning, and the deployment of 5G networks are potential future developments that may impact the security and privacy of smart city environments. Proactive measures can be taken to address these
challenges, such as implementing strong authentication and access
control mechanisms, regularly monitoring and updating devices, using
privacy-preserving techniques for AI and machine learning algorithms,
and implementing strong encryption and access control mechanisms for
5G networks.
The city’s data collection and analysis rely on the European Union’s
Broker, which can manage data from diverse sources and types. The
Broker platform offers real-time graphical visualization of data, which
facilitates urban mobility, environmental monitoring, energy efficiency,
urban infrastructure management, and other daily activities (Harris,
2021). By enabling access to data for both managers and citizens, the
platform has contributed to increased transparency, trust, and citizen
participation. One notable advantage of the platform is its ease of use, as
both city managers and ordinary citizens can use data without needing
to handle raw data (Bennett, Durana, and Konecny, 2020, Evans and
Horak, 2021). Another recent innovation in Vienna is the Wien-Bot, an
AI chatbot that answers citizen questions and continuously learns from
conversations. Wien-Bot can suggest other questions and provide
pre-prepared answers based on frequently asked questions and relevant
keywords. Furthermore, Wien-Bot is integrated into the city’s main
website, where it answers questions and provides various citizen services (Evans and Horak, 2021, Cenedese et al., 2014, Lu, Wang, and Wu,
2020, Chapman, 2021).
The questions asked through Wien-Bot are updated and include
recent issues such as the coronavirus disease. Vienna’s efforts to employ
technology to manage urban operations have resulted in consecutive
first-place rankings in the Smart City Strategy Index for two years. Fig. 5
shows an effective data governance is crucial for the successful implementation of smart cities. This involves establishing an appropriate
model for data governance, ensuring transparency and accessibility of
Fig. 4. Reasons why AI-based urban operations are important to citizens.
L. Xia et al. 
Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771
14
data exchange mechanisms, and implementing standards that guarantee
data exchange. It is also important for cities to address the risk of
increased discrimination by promoting diversity in teams and providing
adequate training. Ultimately, effective data governance is essential for
maintaining data accuracy, increasing public trust, and ensuring the
responsible use of data in smart city development. The comparison of
research studies (Burke and Zvarikova, 2021, Rizi and Seno, 2022,
Choenni, Bargh, Busker, and Netten, 2022, Redouane and Aissa, 2017,
Agha et al., 2022, Song, Dian, and Chen, 2023, Salman and Hasar, 2023,
Cui and Cao, 2022, Abadía, Walther, Osman, and Smarsly, 2022, Zhu,
Shen, and Ren, 2022, Wu, Xie, and Lyu, 2023, Lnenicka et al., 2022, Al
Sharif and Pokharel, 2022, Kutty et al., 2022, Adali, Oztas ¨ ¸, Oztas ¨ ¸, and
Tus¸, 2022, Chithaluru, Al-Turjman, Kumar, and Stephan, 2023, Bes¸tepe
and Yildirim, 2022, Siokas, Kelaidi, and Tsakanikas, 2022) reveals a
wide range of topics related to smart cities, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of this field. One crucial theme that emerges from these
studies is the significance of effective data governance in smart city
development. One article (Rizi and Seno, 2022) provides a systematic
review of technologies and solutions that can enhance the security and
privacy protection of citizens in smart cities. Similarly, Choenni et al.
(Choenni, Bargh, Busker, and Netten, 2022) discuss the challenges and
potential solutions associated with data governance in smart cities.
Sustainability is another key theme that emerges from the literature.
Many researchers evaluate the environmental impact of smart city initiatives, focusing on issues such as air pollution, water management, and
transportation (Redouane and Aissa, 2017, Agha et al., 2022). Song et al.
(Song, Dian, and Chen, 2023) investigate whether smart city construction can improve carbon productivity. Additionally, Salman et al. (Salman and Hasar, 2023) study the use of IoT techniques for smart
applications related to water, waste, air pollution, and transportation.
Several studies also emphasize the importance of public-private partnerships and collaboration between different stakeholders in smart city
development (Cui and Cao, 2022, Abadía, Walther, Osman, and Smarsly,
2022, Zhu, Shen, and Ren, 2022, Wu, Xie, and Lyu, 2023, Lnenicka et al.,
2022, Al Sharif and Pokharel, 2022, Kutty et al., 2022, Adali, Oztas ¨ ¸,
Oztas ¨ ¸, and Tus¸, 2022, Chithaluru, Al-Turjman, Kumar, and Stephan,
2023, Bes¸tepe and Yildirim, 2022). Siokas et al. (Siokas, Kelaidi, and
Tsakanikas, 2022) argue that smart cities can serve as hubs for nurturing
public-private partnerships. The literature suggests that smart city
development requires collaboration between various disciplines and
stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and
citizens. By working together, these stakeholders can create sustainable
and livable cities that address the challenges of urbanization and provide better services to citizens.
6.4. Case studies on Cascais and Hong Kong’s AI applications for urban
services
To improve the quality and efficiency of its services, particularly in
areas such as urban security, public transportation, and infrastructure
management, the city has sought to experiment with innovative solutions (Cenedese et al., 2014, Lu, Wang, and Wu, 2020). It has successfully developed technology-based services, including remote payment
systems for parking lots and low-consumption buildings. However, the
lack of a unified approach among urban sectors such as health, education, energy, and others posed a challenge. The city established a digital
command center named C2, which utilizes the City Synergy operating
system designed by Deloitte for smart city and digitization purposes (Lu,
Wang, and Wu, 2020). Cascais has been able to change its model for
urban operations, resulting in increased efficiency and service quality
for its citizens. The Cascais urban platform comprises various elements,
such as citizen participation applications, maps, online dashboards,
thematic reports, and smart twin cities. The Deputy Mayor of Cascais
stated that citizens’ desire for the future is a municipality with a predictive management center (Chapman, 2021). To meet this need, the
Cascais urban platform has data analysis and correlation evaluation
capabilities, which can aid decision-making and prediction of citizens’
needs. Another objective is to decrease road operating costs by 40% by
integrating traffic data and road status (Burke and Zvarikova, 2021, Rizi
and Seno, 2022, Choenni, Bargh, Busker, and Netten, 2022, Redouane
and Aissa, 2017, Agha et al., 2022, Song, Dian, and Chen, 2023).
Furthermore, Cascais has been successful in increasing citizen satisfaction, exemplified by a 30% decrease in water consumption and a 20%
reduction in electricity consumption. Cascais can serve as a model city
for other urban centers. In Hong Kong and China, there is a continuous
effort to develop AI applications in both government and public sectors
(Tortonesi et al., 2016, Mohanty, Choppali, and Kougianos, 2016, Burke
and Zvarikova, 2021). The primary focus of Hong Kong is the integration
of AI in the management of city services, such as utilizing chatbots to
address citizens’ queries and grievances. Another intended use is the
incorporation of AI in traffic management, where 80% of the city’s
traffic routes currently have access to data related to traffic speed and
volume, which is used to alleviate congestion (Bennett, Durana, and
Konecny, 2020, Evans and Horak, 2021). Furthermore, Hong Kong is
well-equipped for emergencies, as it not only possesses remarkable capabilities for collecting traffic data, but it also prepares its sensors for
water levels, energy consumption, pollution, and landslides. In the
healthcare sector, AI is utilized to plan the weekly work schedules of
thousands of nurses in hospitals. Additionally, the city is in the process
of planning for the deployment of robots within the next 20 years, as a
third of the population is expected to be over 65 years of age (Evans and
Horak, 2021, Cenedese et al., 2014, Lu, Wang, and Wu, 2020, Chapman,
2021, Burke and Zvarikova, 2021). For a considerable period, research
has focused on the security and privacy of information in smart cities
across various innovation ecosystem sectors. To provide smart services
like smart healthcare and smart governance, it is crucial to safeguard
information transmitted to various internet-connected devices. Ensuring
information security in a smart city requires the consideration of various
social, economic, and governance aspects. One such dimension is the
security of the city, commonly known as a safe city. Safe cities leverage
technology to aid governments, communities, and businesses in
reducing the likelihood of crime and creating a secure and comfortable
environment for citizens. Smart city’s purpose to meet society’s needs in

light of current environmental and social challenges. Protection of the
community, assets, environment, and information is crucial in a safe
city. Typically, surveillance systems monitor traffic, transportation,
public areas, criminal activity zones, social facilities, and residential
areas in most safe city projects (Burke and Zvarikova, 2021, Harris,
2021, Bennett, Durana, and Konecny, 2020, Evans and Horak, 2021).
Rapid urbanization and advancements in ICT are crucial factors that
influence urban planning and security. Smart cities are becoming
increasingly popular as a way to improve the quality of life for citizens
while also addressing a range of environmental, economic, and social
challenges (Cenedese et al., 2014, Lu, Wang, and Wu, 2020, Chapman,
2021, Burke and Zvarikova, 2021, Rizi and Seno, 2022). In recent years,
a variety of technologies and solutions have been developed to improve
security and privacy protection in smart cities (Rizi and Seno, 2022).
However, data governance remains a challenge in smart cities, with the
need for effective solutions to ensure the responsible use of data
(Choenni, Bargh, Busker, and Netten, 2022). Environmental aspects are
also a crucial concern in smart city development. An air pollution is a
major issue for many cities, and studies have investigated the characterization of gaseous pollutants from industrial complexes (Redouane
and Aissa, 2017). Other studies have explored the use of nanofluids and
turbulators to enhance solar thermal collectors, and the applications of
cyclic olefin copolymer in microfluidics and microdevices (Agha et al.,
2022). Song et al. (Song, Dian, and Chen, 2023) in 2023 described that
smart city development can also impact carbon productivity, and some
studies have investigated the relationship between smart city construction and carbon productivity. In addition, the use of IoT techniques
has been explored to address environmental challenges in smart cities,
such as water, waste, air pollution, and transportation (Salman and
Hasar, 2023). The impact of smart city development on environmental
pollution has also been studied, with evidence from smart city pilots in
China suggesting that urban digital transformation can have complex
impacts on environmental pollution (Cui and Cao, 2022). Transparency
of open data ecosystems is also important for smart city development,
and some studies have assessed the maturity of transparency in smart
cities (Abadía, Walther, Osman, and Smarsly, 2022, Zhu, Shen, and Ren,
2022, Wu, Xie, and Lyu, 2023, Lnenicka et al., 2022). While smart city
development brings many benefits, there are also associated risks that
need to be considered. A review of literature has identified various smart
city dimensions and associated risks (Al Sharif and Pokharel, 2022). The
sustainability performance of European smart cities has also been
assessed using novel approaches such as DEA with double frontiers and
integrated grey MCDM (Kutty et al., 2022, Adali, Oztas ¨ ¸, Oztas ¨ ¸, and Tus¸,
2022). To ensure the successful implementation of smart city projects,
public-private partnerships are essential (Chithaluru, Al-Turjman,
Kumar, and Stephan, 2023). However, the acceptance of IoT-based and
sustainability-oriented smart city services is not always guaranteed, and
studies have explored the factors that influence citizens’ acceptance of
such services (Bes¸tepe and Yildirim, 2022). Siokas et al. (Siokas, Kelaidi,
and Tsakanikas, 2022) shows that smart city development is a complex
and multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of a range
of factors. The studies reviewed here provide valuable insights into the
challenges and opportunities associated with smart city development,
and offer potential solutions to address these challenges. This study
discussed the focuses on the potential security and privacy issues that
arise from the increasing use of AI and IoT in smart cities which provides
a comprehensive overview of these issues, including the vulnerabilities
of smart city technologies to cyber-attacks and other security threats.
Additionally, the study explores the privacy risks associated with the
collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Also, this study emphasizes the need for effective security measures and privacy protection
policies to ensure the safety and security of smart cities. Smart cities are
increasingly being developed and implemented using advanced technologies to improve the quality of life for citizens. However, the use of
such technologies raises concerns about data security and privacy.
Various research studies have been conducted on transportation,
security, privacy, and data analytics, among other topics (Qin et al.,
2023, Zhang et al., 2023, Cheng et al., 2022). One study investigated the
short-term effects of driving restrictions on air quality in urban areas,
while another explored the use of adversarial perturbation to defend
against model stealing attacks. Bayesian learning was reexamined for
data analysis with a focus on prior and inference in sparsity-aware
modeling (Chen et al., 2022, Cao et al., 2021, Cao et al., 2021). The
utilization of underground spaces in the central city of Nanjing was
examined through a dynamic population distribution approach. Physical layer security was enhanced in an uplink non-orthogonal multiple
access system using energy harvesting jammers, and wireless-powered
non-orthogonal multiple access systems were developed to achieve
secure and reliable communications (Yao et al., 2023, Guan et al., 2023,
Li and Sun, 2020). A defense scheme based on deep reinforcement
learning was proposed for autonomous vehicle networks to counter
jamming and eavesdropping attacks, while deep invertible networks
were utilized for multiple images hiding (Guo et al., 2022, Liu et al.,
2022, Xiao and Konak, 2016).
Stock investment strategies were formulated based on support vector
machine parameter optimization algorithms, and the spatiotemporal
pattern of perceived urban noise was analyzed using social perception
data. A new design paradigm for duty-cycling communication was
introduced, and the heterogeneous green vehicle routing and scheduling
problem was addressed (Luan et al., 2022, Tan and Li, 2022, Cheng, Zhu,
Zhao, and Chen, 2016). A robust two-stage location allocation method
was proposed for emergency temporary blood supply in post-disaster
settings. In a case study, the current administrative accountability system for work safety accidents in the chemical industry in China was
examined with a focus on improving accountability. The event-driven
SOA paradigm was used to achieve situation-aware IoTs service coordination (Liu et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023). House vacancy dynamics were monitored using NPP-VIIRS night-time light
remote sensing images, and multi-modal fusion in visual question
answering was reviewed with an emphasis on attention mechanisms. As
such, privacy-by-design solutions are increasingly necessary to address
these challenges. In recent years, a significant amount of research has
been conducted to examine security and privacy issues in smart cities. A
comprehensive survey of cybersecurity, data privacy, and policy issues
in cyber-physical system deployments in smart cities highlights the
importance of integrating security and privacy considerations into the
design of such systems. Several studies have focused on
privacy-preservation by conceptualizing smart cities using MIDR, which
entails a multi-level intrusion detection and response system to protect
privacy. Furthermore, privacy-aware big data analytics as a service has
been proposed for public health policies in smart cities, which involves
using anonymization techniques and data de-identification to safeguard
sensitive information (Badu-Marfo, Farooq, Mensah, and Al Mallah,
2023, Habibzadeh et al., 2019, Braun, Fung, Iqbal, and Shah, 2018,
Anjum et al., 2018, Anisetti et al., 2018).
7. Conclusion
A smart city utilizes ICT to enhance operational efficiency, share
independent information within the system, and improve total service
effectiveness and citizen welfare. The implementation of smart technology and safe cities is often considered a viable solution for various
urban challenges, such as transportation, waste management, and
environmental protection. However, security concerns and crime prevention are frequently overlooked. Additionally, researchers seldom
discuss the implementation of new intelligent security technologies. The
safe city concept faces challenges such as "control". The enhancement of
urban safety is a significant undertaking for city developers and can be
achieved through various means. The first step in this process is to
identify problems and potential threats, followed by presenting the most
effective solutions for these problems. The objective of the safe city,
while preserving citizens’ privacy, is to establish an emergency response

Sustainable Cities and Society 98 (2023) 104771

plan. All key stakeholders in cities, including police, fire departments,
emergency medical services, city government, internal security, transit,
water, and power services, must provide an effective safety or security
response to any situation that affects citizens or organizations. Initially
intended as a framework for natural disaster safety, smart safe cities
have expanded to cover all aspects of safety in the city. Consequently,
this knowledge can be viewed as part of a smart city or one of its subbranches, which addresses all aspects of safety within the city. The
implementation of intelligent technologies, serving the purpose of
safety, creates a SCI. To ensure readiness and prompt response to potential emergencies, a smart and secure city system should possess key
features, including but not limited to, healthcare systems, intelligent
traffic systems and routes, smart safety systems for monitoring, search
and identification, smart crisis management systems for decisionmaking, early warning, monitoring and prediction of emergency and
environmental conditions, central police units, an integrated rescue
system (IRS), secure internet connectivity and data protection, data
processing centers, and cyber security supported by AI. These components can be further divided into interconnected parts, which are connected via the IoTs or other methods, and the system’s level of
intelligence can be evaluated based on their implementation. With the
advent of IoT, a smart city encompasses heterogeneous network infrastructures and intelligent information control and processing systems
that can monitor the physical world in real-time and provide intelligent
services to residents and travelers in various fields such as transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns have arisen due to smart city
applications collecting a broad range of sensitive information on people’s privacy and social gatherings, as well as controlling city facilities
and impacting people’s lives. This article examines security and privacy
in urban applications and operations, particularly the characteristics of a
secure smart city and the challenges of maintaining privacy and security
with the aid of AI. Some research efforts have been conducted to address
these privacy and security challenges in smart healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Ultimately, it is evident that cities across
the globe are making efforts to transition into smart cities. Safety represents a crucial aspect of urban life quality. Consequently, it can be
argued that a smart city must also prioritize safety as an integral
component. Generally, the idea of a smart and safe city involves
providing a comprehensive platform that supports the implementation
and integration of surveillance and emergency communication systems.
However, this concept lacks global acceptance and standardization since
current approaches vary among cities and offer unique services that
cannot be readily consolidated at higher levels. Thus, while general
recommendations can be proposed for cities worldwide, individual
evaluations and assessments must be conducted for each city based on
its amenities, lifestyle, climate, urban culture, and citizen
characteristics.
7.1. Future perspectives
The proposed Theory-dependent Innovative Optimization Model
(TIOM) offers a practical and integrated approach to addressing the
security and privacy concerns of smart cities. However, there is still
much work to be done in this area. One important area for future
research is the development of more effective security measures and
privacy protection policies that can be implemented by city administrators and policymakers. Additionally, there is a need for further
research on the potential risks associated with smart city technologies
and the development of new solutions to address them. Finally, more
research is needed on the economic and social impacts of smart cities,
particularly on vulnerable populations.
