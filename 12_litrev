# Literature Review: Deductive Qualitative Research

## Introduction

Deductive, exploratory research is a neglected topic in the field of qualitative research. However, recent
developments have highlighted the importance of using working hypotheses as a framework for these
studies. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research findings on deductive qualitative
approaches, explore the downsides of exploratory qualitative research, and emphasize the need for
qualitative rigor in exploratory research. The review draws on a significant body of work on deductive
qualitative approaches, including studies by Gilgun (2005, 2015), Hyde (2000), and Pearse (2019). The
use of conceptual frameworks derived from comprehensive literature reviews and a priori theorizing were
common practices in qualitative research before the publication of Glaser and Strauss's (1967) seminal
work, "The Discovery of Grounded Theory". Gilgun (2015) introduced the term "Deductive Qualitative
Analysis" to describe these approaches.

## Deductive Qualitative Approaches: A Response to "The Discovery of Grounded Theory"

Before Glaser and Strauss's publication in 1967, qualitative research often relied on the use of conceptual frameworks derived from comprehensive literature reviews and a priori theorizing (Gilgun, 2015;
Menassa, 2010). These practices allowed researchers to develop deductive qualitative approaches that
applied existing theories to explore new phenomena. However, "The Discovery of Grounded Theory"
marked a turning point in qualitative research, promoting an inductive approach that emphasized the
generation of theory from data (Gilgun, 2015).

## The Downsides of Exploratory Qualitative Research

While the inductive approach advocated by Glaser and Strauss has its merits, exploratory qualitative
research has its downsides. One of the key challenges is the lack of structure and guidance, which can
lead to a lack of focus and clarity in research findings (Casula et al., 2020). Without a clear framework,
researchers may struggle to make sense of their data and draw meaningful conclusions. Additionally, exploratory qualitative research often lacks the rigor and replicability associated with deductive approaches
(Casula et al., 2020). This can undermine the credibility and generalizability of the research findings.

## Qualitative Rigor in Exploratory Research: Deductive Qualitative Analysis

To address the downsides of exploratory qualitative research and ensure qualitative rigor, researchers
have turned to deductive qualitative analysis. This approach involves the use of working hypotheses
as a framework for exploratory research (Casula et al., 2020). Working hypotheses serve as guiding
principles that provide structure and direction to the research process. They help researchers focus their
data collection and analysis, ensuring that the research remains grounded and systematic.

## Synthesis of Research Findings

Several studies have explored the potential of deductive qualitative analysis in various domains. For
example, Menassa (2010) conducted an exploratory study on the quality and extent of social disclosures
by Lebanese commercial banks using a deductive qualitative approach. The study employed a conceptual
framework derived from a comprehensive literature review to guide the data collection and analysis
process. The findings highlighted the importance of using deductive approaches to enhance the quality
and reliability of social disclosures.
In another study, Casula et al. (2020) investigated the potential of working hypotheses for deductive
exploratory research. The researchers conducted a qualitative study in which they developed and tested
working hypotheses related to the impact of technology on the workforce. The findings demonstrated the
value of working hypotheses in providing structure and focus to the research process, resulting in more
meaningful and actionable insights.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing research on deductive qualitative approaches provides valuable insights, there are
still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. One such gap is the limited understanding of the
application of deductive qualitative analysis in different research contexts. Future research could explore
the effectiveness of deductive approaches in diverse domains and examine the challenges and benefits
associated with their implementation.
Additionally, more research is needed to understand the specific strategies and techniques that researchers
can employ to ensure qualitative rigor in deductive exploratory research. This includes exploring the
integration of deductive and inductive approaches to capitalize on the strengths of both methods. By
combining deductive frameworks with inductive data analysis, researchers may be able to achieve a more
comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena.
Furthermore, future research could investigate the role of working hypotheses in enhancing the validity
and reliability of qualitative research findings. By examining the impact of working hypotheses on the
research process and outcomes, researchers can gain insights into the effectiveness of this approach and
identify strategies for optimizing its use.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, deductive qualitative approaches have emerged as a response to the publication of Glaser
and Strauss's "The Discovery of Grounded Theory". These approaches draw on the use of conceptual
frameworks and a priori theorizing, which were common practices in qualitative research before the
influential publication. Exploratory qualitative research has its downsides, including a lack of structure
and rigor. To address these challenges, researchers have turned to deductive qualitative analysis, which
involves the use of working hypotheses as a framework for exploratory research. The existing research
highlights the value of deductive approaches in enhancing the quality, focus, and reliability of qualitative
research findings. However, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, and future research
should explore the application, strategies, and benefits of deductive qualitative analysis in different
contexts.
