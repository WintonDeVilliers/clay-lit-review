# Literature Review: Factors Influencing Medical Tourism Development in Malaysia

Medical tourism has emerged as a rapidly growing sector within the broader tourism industry, offering
individuals the opportunity to travel abroad to seek healthcare and wellness services. The development
of medical tourism in developing countries, including Malaysia, is influenced by various factors. This
literature review aims to identify and synthesize the key factors affecting medical tourism development
in Malaysia, as evidenced in the existing research literature. Furthermore, potential knowledge gaps and
future research directions will be highlighted.

## Patient Experience and Decision-Making Processes

Understanding the patient's experience and decision-making processes is crucial to comprehending the
factors that influence medical tourism development. Crooks et al. (2010) conducted a scoping review
to explore the patient's experience of medical tourism. The findings revealed that patients' decision to
engage in medical tourism is driven by factors such as cost savings, quality of care, and access to specific
treatments. Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of trust and information sources in the
decision-making process.
Johnston et al. (2012) conducted a qualitative study to gain insights into the decision-making processes of
Canadian medical tourists. The research shed light on the complex and dynamic nature of decision-making, with patients relying on various information sources and seeking emotional support from their social
networks. The study emphasized the need for tailored information and support services to assist patients
in making informed decisions.
Henson et al. (2015) investigated the motivators, decision factors, and information sources influencing
individuals predisposed to medical tourism. The study identified factors such as cost, quality, and
accessibility of healthcare services as key motivators. Furthermore, the research highlighted the role of
online information sources and personal recommendations in shaping decision-making processes.

## Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)

The emergence of web-based health information platforms has greatly influenced the landscape of
medical tourism. Lunt et al. (2010) examined the role of ICTs in facilitating medical tourism and the
provision of health information. The study highlighted the increasing popularity of web-based platforms

that offer information on healthcare providers, treatments, and patient testimonials. It emphasized the
need for effective regulation and quality assurance to ensure the reliability and accuracy of online health
information.

## Ethical and Legal Implications

The ethical and legal implications of medical tourism have been a subject of concern. Crooks et al. (2012)
conducted a qualitative study to explore the perspectives of Canadian health and safety representatives on
the risks of medical tourism. The research highlighted the potential ethical and legal challenges, including
issues related to patient safety, informed consent, and post-operative care. The study emphasized the
importance of ensuring adequate regulation and oversight to protect the rights and well-being of medical
tourists.
Adams et al. (2013) investigated the perspectives of medical tourists on ethical concerns in medical
tourism. The study examined the impact of an information sheet on promoting social responsibility among
healthcare users. The findings highlighted the need for transparent and accessible information to empower
patients to make ethically informed decisions.

## Readiness and Decision-Making Models

Ormond and Sulianti (2017) focused on the readiness of countries to engage in medical tourism and
developed a decision-making model. The research emphasized the need for comprehensive readiness
assessments, taking into account factors such as infrastructure, healthcare quality, government support,
and cultural competence.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing literature provides valuable insights into the factors influencing medical tourism
development in Malaysia, several knowledge gaps and areas for future research can be identified.
Firstly, there is a need for further research on the specific factors that attract medical tourists to Malaysia.
Understanding the unique selling points of Malaysian healthcare, such as cost-effectiveness, quality, and
specialized treatments, can inform targeted marketing strategies.
Secondly, research could explore the role of healthcare accreditation and international collaborations in
enhancing the competitiveness of Malaysian healthcare providers. Investigating the impact of accreditation on patient decision-making and trust could provide valuable insights.

Thirdly, the influence of cultural factors on medical tourism decision-making deserves further attention.
Exploring how cultural norms, beliefs, and expectations shape patients' preferences and choices can
inform the development of culturally sensitive healthcare services.
Lastly, research could focus on the long-term outcomes and experiences of medical tourists in Malaysia.
Understanding patients' post-treatment experiences, including satisfaction levels, health outcomes, and
post-operative care, can contribute to the continuous improvement of healthcare services.
In conclusion, this literature review has provided an overview of the key factors influencing medical
tourism development in Malaysia. The patient experience, decision-making processes, information and
communication technologies, ethical and legal implications, readiness, and decision-making models have
been explored. The review has also highlighted knowledge gaps and suggested potential future research
directions in the field of medical tourism in Malaysia. By addressing these gaps, policymakers and
healthcare providers can better understand and cater to the needs of medical tourists, ultimately enhancing
Malaysia's position as a medical tourism destination.
