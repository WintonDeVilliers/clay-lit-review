Abstract
As the internet penetration rate in Africa increases, so does the proliferation of the Internet of
Things (IoT) devices. Along with this growth in internet access is the risk of cyberattacks to
vulnerable IoT devices mushrooming in the African cyberspace. One way to determine IoT
vulnerabilities is to find open ports within Africa’s cyberspace. Our research leverages Shodan
search engine, a powerful tool for discovering IoT devices facing the public internet, to find open
ports across Africa. We conduct an analysis of our findings, ranking countries from most to least
vulnerable to cyberattack. We find that South Africa,Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are
the five countries most susceptible to cyberattack on the continent. Further, 69.8% of devices
having one of the five most commonly open internet ports have had past documented
vulnerabilities. Following our analysis, we conclude with policy recommendations for both the
public and private sector.
Key words: SHODAN, Internet of Things (IoTs), Africa, Cyberspace
1. Introduction
Despite technology remaining a bottleneck in its industrialization efforts, the African continent,
home to approximately 1.4 billion people, is said to be on the cusp of colossal changes as the
next frontier of the transformative digital boom. According to Internet World Stats estimations,
as of December 31, 2021, Africa has 590.3 million internet users. This corresponds to an internet
penetration rate of 43% and a growth rate of 12,975% from 2000 to 2021 (Internet World Stats,
2022). The corollary of an increased internet penetration rate is the rapid proliferation of the
Internet of Things (IoT) into smart homes and critical infrastructures such as military
applications, Industrial Control Systems (ICS), hospitals, and financial institutions. Nevertheless,
the promise of a digital Africa has a sordid underbelly: every year, African economies lose
millions of dollars to cybercrime.
As Africa digitizes, its critical infrastructure in cyberspace remains vulnerable to cyberattacks
from rogue nation-states, international malicious actors, terrorists, and homegrown cybercrime
syndicates. Arguably unbeknownst to many African stakeholders (governments, technology
developers, and policy makers), there are many vulnerable devices across the African
cyberspace. As per the 2021 African Cyberthreat Assessment Report by the International
Criminal Police Organization (commonly known as Interpol), in 2021 alone, cybercrime reduced
Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than 10%, which is equivalent to an estimated
$4.12 billion (Interpol, 2021).
Despite the stakes involved, there is no research into the nature of vulnerable IoTs that face the
public internet. Our research aims to conduct an in-depth study that clearly maps the vulnerable
IoT devices in the entire region. Using Shodan, a search engine for indexing vulnerable IoT
devices connected to the public internet, we unravel which ports in the Africa cyberspace are
susceptible to being overtaken by malicious actors. Cybercriminals can leverage these
vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access into systems, plant malware into devices, and disrupt
an organization’s service by mounting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
One of the ways criminals can gain unauthorized access into systems is through exploiting
vulnerabilities in open ports that are listening for services. Before proceeding to the rest of our
research, it is prudent we introduce the concept of ports and Shodan.
1. 1 Ports
A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end (Cloudflare, n.d.). These points
are managed by a computer’s operating system,which determines the kind of services each port
operates. Operating a service includes either running a process or sending and receiving data
packets from other ports. Ports enable computers to identify different kinds of network traffic.
This then enables the routing of different services such as the delivery of a webpage’s content
and email delivery through dedicated ports. Figure 1 shows a diagram of a computer using port
443 to gain access to the internet through a HTTPS connection. The computer can also connect
to the internet through port 80, meant for HTTP connections. Port 20 can be used for data
transfers.

Currently, most network applications use fixed port numbers assigned by the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA). The majority of internet applications included in these network
applications use either of two key protocols to transmit their data packets: Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Open ports can receive data packets from
other ports across the internet. Some ports are reserved for specific system functions and are
therefore required to be open. Closed ports reject or ignore packets, but this also means they
cannot receive data via packets from another port or device. The presence of either a TCP or a
UDP port for these network applications implies the existence of a channel that can be exploited
by a system intruder. Intruders can gain access to systems by exploiting common ports and
sending attacks to the host through known system bugs. Intruders can also plant trojan horses
through backdoors created via open port vulnerabilities. Through the use of Shodan, an Open
Source Intelligence tool, we conducted a vulnerability assessment of open ports across Africa’s
cyberspace.
1.2 Shodan
In our daily browsing of the internet, we leverage web search engines such as Google Search and
Microsoft Bing to search for content on the internet. Behind the scenes, search engines crawl the
internet, index the content found during the crawling process, and render the relevant content to
the user in a ranked order (Moz, n.d.). These search engines are used to find relevant content on
websites. While the search engine Shodan shares parallels with these search engines, its
fundamental difference is that it is a search engine for internet-connected devices.
Shodan can be described as a reconnaissance tool used by cybersecurity researchers and hackers,
both ethical and malicious, to crawl the entire internet sphere and scan for IoT devices facing the
public internet. It utilizes distributed port scanners throughout the globe to randomly select target
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and identify listening TCP and UDP ports. Due to the distributed
nature of the port scanners, Shodan is able to search for open ports across all IP ranges and
bypass any domestic or international bans for another country’s IP ranges. Shodan randomly
generates the IP addresses it scans rather than scanning through the addresses sequentially. This
has been shown to ensure a uniform coverage of the internet and prevent bias in data collection
(Matherly, 2015). The listening TCP and UDP ports are further enumerated to gather protocol
banners, web pages, and other service data. In essence, Shodan’s powerful algorithms grab the
device/service banners and metadata that the server would normally send back to the client. On
the one hand, banners refer to the textual information that describes the services running on a
device. For web servers, banner information boils down to the headers that detail the type and
version of the web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) in place. On the other hand, metadata about the
device entails such information as geographic location, Operating System (OS), hostname, and
more (Matherly, 2015).

2. Data and Methodology
We used Shodan’s search interface and Python to query results from the platform. Each Shodan
search result includes the IP address of the host whose port is open. Each result also has metadata
on the port including its function, name, location, and more. Shodan also makes its data available
through API endpoints that serve individual results or bulk data. For each country in Africa, we
gathered the distribution of open ports by their port numbers. We identified each open port’s
functions through its port number and metadata, thereby deciphering whether it is vulnerable to
attack. Conducting this analysis on each country’s open ports enabled us to compare each
region’s vulnerability to cyberattack. We analyzed data to find the most commonly open ports
across Africa and each country’s and region’s top open ports. We also ranked the countries based
on their degree of vulnerability to cyberattacks from most vulnerable to least vulnerable.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Most Commonly Open Ports
We find that connected devices across Africa are highly vulnerable to attacks. Three of the five
most commonly open ports that devices across Africa use have documented vulnerabilities. We
also find that 69.8% of the devices with one of the five most commonly open ports are
vulnerable to cyberattacks.
As shown in Figure 2, the most open port is port number 7547, used by Internet Service
Providers to communicate and update home routers. Infected routers account for 75% of attacks
online (Norton, 2021).Vulnerabilities in this port have been used by malicious actors in the past
to gain access to and control of the underlying device (Security Intelligence, 2016; C.P.S.
Technologies, n.d.). Home routers are a particularly vulnerable attack vector because they
function as a residential gateway, bridging a myriad of devices in households to the Wide Area
Network or internet. This position means they can be used to access other devices connected to
the router such as security cameras, webcams, smart TVs, and home devices such as Alexa. In
avenues where these home routers with open ports are used to operate businesses, routers could
be used to take control of the industrial control systems connected to them. In India, a
vulnerability on port 7547 led to two state telecommunication companies having over 60,000
devices disconnected from the internet during an attack (Cimpanu, 2017). A similar attack in
Germany in 2016 left 900,000 customers offline (Krebs on Security, 2016). Open ports on home
routers can be used to collect user credentials, which then can be used to gain access to business
systems or personal accounts. Credentials could include information such as credit card numbers,
social media account login details, and even website or admin server access. These credentials
could be used for identity theft and to access company information, such as customers’ financial
details, and even to access critical servers. Data on internet use, such as website and search
histories, as recorded in the port traffic data would also leave users vulnerable to targeted or mass
surveillance.
3.2 Top Open Ports per region
We analyze open port data across Africa’s five regions: Northern Africa, Eastern Africa, Western
Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. We find that Northern and Southern Africa have the
greatest number of connected devices with open ports that either have vulnerabilities or
communicate through unencrypted channels that malicious actors can use to listen to messages
being sent or received by the port.
Table 1 lists the most commonly open ports per region. The Eastern and Western Africa regions
have fewer ports open a

3.3 Countries with Most Open Ports
Matching the open port data to each country’s metadata allowed us to find the number of open
ports per country. This enabled us to analyze how vulnerable each country is to cyberattack.
Depending on the networks a device is connected to, the unauthorized access of an open port in
one country could lead to security vulnerabilities in other countries as well. For example, a
cybercriminal gaining access to the device of a multinational institution might be able to access
that organization’s devices set up in another country either through backdoors, other forms of
malware or social engineering. In Figure 3, we see that South Africa has the highest number of
open ports. The previous regional breakdown suggests that these ports are mostly used for home
routers, HTTP/HTTPS connections, remote network access, and FTP servers. Security
vulnerabilities that can allow malicious actors to gain access and control of the host have been
discovered in each of these ports apart from HTTPS (Security Intelligence, 2016; Abdulqader,
2016; McNulty, 2020).
3.4 Mapping Cyber Vulnerability Across Africa
Figure 4 shows a heatmap of cyber vulnerability across Africa. Some of the most vulnerable
countries include South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Nigeria, and Kenya.

4. Limitations and Further Work
Our study has taken steps to explore cyber vulnerability in Africa through synthesizing data on
open ports across Africa’s cyberspace. The current ranking of cyber vulnerability relies on a
simple probabilistic model, where a higher number of open ports means more attack vectors for
cybercriminals. A higher number of attack vectors means a greater likelihood of cybercriminals
gaining unauthorized access to the open port’s underlying systems. Thus, the more open ports a
country has, the more likely it is to be vulnerable to cyberattacks. It would be interesting to also
use data on historical attacks, such as the timeline and frequency of attacks on specific ports and
devices. This would provide more detailed information on how susceptible each port is to attack
according to historical data. Aggregating this data at the national level and comparing it to
current open ports would enable researchers to better understand how two or more countries
compare even when they have similar open port counts. Investigating country-specific
cybersecurity policies would also enable researchers to identify countries with proactive or active
responses to cyber threats as compared to those where little oversight on cybersecurity exists.
5. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations
Using Open Source Intelligence tools, we identified open ports across Africa’s connected
devices. We further analyzed device metadata to conduct an assessment of each country’s cyber
vulnerability, ranking countries from most vulnerable to least vulnerable to cyberattacks. A
complete list of rankings is available in Appendix A. We find that a significant number of the
most commonly open ports on devices can be compromised. Because the most commonly open
and vulnerable devices are home routers, the data raises privacy concerns for individuals and
organizations alike. Cyberattacks are a real threat to African countries, and policy efforts are key
to improving the resilience of connected devices. This in turn nurtures growing technology
ecosystems and encourages the widespread adoption of technology, which is a key factor of
economic growth.
In light of our research findings, we recommend that ISPs and organizations adopt policies that
spearhead the implementation of the following key considerations:
Patching vulnerable IoT devices
As soon as vulnerabilities are discovered on a given port or another service, it behooves the
system administrators of organizations and the R&D teams at the ISPs to immediately conduct
patch management, the process of distributing and applying updates to software. Patches are
required in rectifying found vulnerabilities or bugs in a software. The quicker these patches are
made, the more secure and less vulnerable the IoT devices would be.
Port hardening
Internet-based communication occurs through ports; as such, for a given service to be rendered,
such as sending and receiving an email, a specific port has to be open. However, when legitimate
services are exploited through existing vulnerabilities, as can be done with Shodan, or malware is
introduced to systems, malicious actors can leverage these services in conjunction with open
ports to gain unauthorized access to critical and sensitive data. To prevent such a scenario,
organizations and ISPs should close ports that are not associated with legitimate services, as
open ports on a network increase the attack vectors available to malicious actors. This process,
known as port hardening, includes other measures that ensure that the ports are not discoverable
from the public internet.
Guiding users to adopt best practice credential policies
Shodan contains default credentials (usernames and passwords) that can be used to gain access
into systems. In combination with open ports, these can be used for nefarious purposes.
Organizations are advised to guide their users to adopt best practice policy for selecting strong
credentials. Furthermore, reinforcing that with multi-factor authentication could enhance the
system’s security.
Regular network and system audits
Organizations could require their IT departments to conduct regular system audits. These can be
used to find out whether the institution’s systems have been compromised since their last check
and could also identify unusual behavior on the system’s traffic. These audits can run in real time
and can also be automated to run at regular intervals and alert system administrators to unusual
behavior on the network.
Bounty programs
Institutions have seen success in establishing public bounty programs to help their engineering
teams test software and identify system vulnerabilities. Bounty programs encourage
cybersecurity professionals outside the organization to locate and file system vulnerabilities with
an organization’s engineering department for a reward. This would accelerate the identification
of vulnerabilities before they are used to gain unlawful access into critical systems.
Continental cybersecurity strategy
Previous recommendations have focused on policy practices at the organizational level.
Currently, several countries in Africa have adopted national cybersecurity strategies
(Government of Kenya, 2014; Government of South Africa, 2015). However, the fast-paced
world of technology means that regulation is constantly catching up to the latest innovation.
Adopting a continental cybersecurity policy framework under a common body such as the
African Union would provide guidance to institutions operating in Africa on the baseline
expectations for how they should set up their systems and handle user data. Similar policies such
as the European Commission’s General Data Protection Regulation have been implemented to
protect users’ online privacy (“General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – Official Legal
Text,” 2016).
