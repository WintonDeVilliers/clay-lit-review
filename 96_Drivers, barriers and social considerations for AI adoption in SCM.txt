ABSTRACT
This study explored the challenges and recommendations for implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in SC
Management (SCM). The experts identified several drivers for AI adoption in SCM, including increased efficiency,
improved decision-making, and reduced costs. However, they highlighted several barriers to AI adoption, such as
data quality and management issues, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and trust in AI. To overcome these barriers and ensure successful AI implementation, companies should involve all stakeholders, focus
on data quality and management, and ensure the AI solution integrates with existing processes and workflows. In
addition, companies should also avoid common mistakes when implementing AI, such as neglecting the
importance of explainability and transparency in AI decision-making, underestimating the importance of
involving all stakeholders, and rushing into large-scale implementation without conducting small-scale pilot
projects. By following the recommendations and avoiding common mistakes, companies can harness the benefits
of AI in SCM while minimizing risks and challenges.
1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology transforming various industries, including SC Management (SCM). The
integration of AI in SCM offers a range of benefits, such as improved
decision-making, enhanced automation, and zoptimized operations. As
a result, many zorganizations are seeking to implement AI in their SC
operations to gain a competitive advantage. However, adopting AI in
SCM is challenging, and zorganizations must consider the drivers and
barriers to AI adoption. [1]
To gain a deeper understanding of the drivers and barriers of AI in
SCM, a survey was conducted with twelve experts in the field. The experts were selected based on their extensive experience and knowledge
of AI in SCM and their ability to provide insightful analysis of the
challenges and opportunities of AI adoption. The expert interview was
designed to gather the experts’ opinions on the current state of the art
and future trends in the field, as well as the drivers and barriers of AI
adoption in SCM.
As a starting point, all experts received the paper “A survey of
drivers, barriers and social considerations for AI adoption in SCM” and a
PowerPoint presentation with all graphs to consume before the interview. [2]
The survey results provide valuable insights into the drivers and
barriers of AI in SCM, and the expert interviews offer a unique
perspective on the challenges and opportunities of AI adoption in the
field, including recommendations for companies.
This paper presents the results of the expert interviews, including a
discussion of the key drivers and barriers of AI in SCM, the impact of AI
on SC performance, and the implications for zorganizations considering
the adoption of AI in their SC operations. The paper also highlights the
future directions of AI in SCM and the role of AI in shaping the future of
the field.
AI has been identified as a critical enabler for transforming SCM,
providing new opportunities for efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness. [3]
The paper begins with the background of the study, followed by the
methods and the survey approach, including limitations. The results will
be presented in different chapters and include a Summary of the conversations, Drivers and Barriers of AI, Recommendations on implementation and traps to avoid. Next, the results are discussed, and
limitations and implications will be presented. Future research direction
and conclusion will be discussed in the final section.
This paper aims to investigate and present the key drivers and barriers to AI adoption in SCM by conducting expert interviews and zanalyzing survey results. By exploring the challenges, opportunities, and
recommendations for zorganizations considering AI implementation in
their SCM operations, the paper aims to provide valuable insights and
guidance for the future directions of AI in SCM, ultimately contributing

to a deeper understanding of AI’s role in transforming the field and
enhancing competitiveness. In addition, should the paper give recommendations on implementing AI solutions and what points to avoid.
2. Background of the study
The SC encompasses every aspect of delivering a product or service,
from sourcing raw materials to delivering to the end customer. SCM is
the strategic planning and management of the flow of goods, information and money through this process to increase customer satisfaction,
balance supply and demand, reduce waste, and achieve flexible and
efficient production and transportation. [4,5]
AI is a computer system that can perform tasks requiring human-like
intelligence using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. SCM,
by its nature, is very complex and has not just internal but also external
data. AI is a valuable tool in SCM as it can handle large amounts of data
and variables. The application of AI in SCM spans various areas,
including planning, robotics, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and expert systems. [6,7]
Given the labour-intensive nature of SCM and the wealth of information to be processed, AI has become an attractive option. The COVID19 pandemic and the accompanying labour shortage have added to the
attractiveness of AI. However, the adoption of AI in SC is accompanied
by both drivers and barriers. Key drivers include cost savings, efficiency
gains, and reduced time and resources, while barriers include change
management, technical limitations, human acceptance, usability,
knowledge, and implementation costs. [8–10]
In their systematic literature review, Hangl et al. zanalyzed 44 articles on the barriers, drivers, and societal considerations for using AI in
SCM. The authors identify seven research areas, of which algorithms are
the most important. Change management, existing technical limitations,
human acceptance of these techniques, understanding and usability of
these techniques, existing human knowledge, and high cost are the most
critical barriers to the adoption of AI in SCM. The key drivers for AI in
SCM are cost reduction, efficiency, and error reduction. Collaboration
between humans and robots is a crucial social factor. [11]
Integrating AI into SCM can transform the field and offer new opportunities for efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness. AI can
enhance decision-making, automate processes, and zoptimize operations. For instance, AI can help zorganizations better predict demand,
zoptimize inventory levels, and zminimize waste and inefficiencies in
the SC. AI can also help zorganizations better manage risks and respond
to changing customer demands and market conditions. [11,12]
However, companies face several challenges in adopting AI in SCM,
including technical, organizational, and cultural factors. Lack of data
quality, inadequate infrastructure, and the need for zspecialized skills
and expertise can present barriers to AI adoption. When introducing AI
in SCM, there may also be resistance to change and concerns about job
losses. [2,13]
Another study by Hangl et al. aimed to identify the drivers, barriers,
and social implications of AI adoption in SCM through a survey conducted in 2022. The survey found that only 45% of respondees used AI in
their organizations, and larger companies were likelier to use it. Robotics and machine learning were the primary AI techniques used in
SCM, with planning, making, and delivery being the main usage areas.
The main drivers of AI adoption were efficiency, time reduction, automation, and data-driven decisions, while the main barriers were understanding AI and data availability and high initial investment costs.
Change management, knowledge of AI, and human acceptance were
considered critical social considerations, and upskilling employees and
making AI explainable were necessary. The study found that AI may
replace human jobs, and there was uncertainty about whether it would
create more jobs than destroy. Finally, there was identified a need for
further research on the ethics of AI. [2]
3. Methods
This study uses a combined approach of qualitative interviews and
statistical analysis to explore the topic. Following the guidelines by
Mayring, the qualitative research method is used to examine social issues in their natural form. [14] This method entails interpreting
non-numerical data, such as that obtained from expert interviews or
observations. [15] The research is guided by theory and aims to make
connections understandable and recognizable. [16]
The primary qualitative data collection method is a content analysis
of twelve expert interviews that focus on drivers and barriers of AI in SC.
This method is commonly used for obtaining subjective experiences and
opinions and zanalyzing unstructured relationships (see Table 1). [17]
The participants for this study were experts in AI and, or SC. The
participants were selected through the following criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:
• At least five years working in a company
• Relevant expertise and experience in the field of study
• Availability and willingness to participate in the research process
• No conflicts of interest or prior contribution to related research
• Sufficient language skills to participate in the study
• Representation from a variety of zorganizations and industries
The semi-structured interviews allow for an open discussion,
explaining the topic or challenge in advance. The interviewer is wellprepared with knowledge of the problem and asks specific questions
to gain expert knowledge on critical topics. [18]
The experts received upfront the paper “A survey of drivers, barriers
and social considerations for AI adoption in SCM”, a PowerPoint presentation with all graphs and the questions of the interview to consume

before the interview. A standardized interview category guides the experts, and critical questions are asked to gather relevant information.
The conversational style is designed to be fluid, enabling further questions and a thorough analysis of specific details. (see Table 2) [14]
The interviews are relaxed and informal to encourage active participation. The interview should last about 1 h.z.z.
Subsequently, the transcripts underwent several processing steps
using Microsoft TEAMS and MaxQDA [18]:
Transcription: The video-recorded interviews were initially converted into a written form using Microsoft TEAMS.
Coding with MaxQDA: The transcripts were coded using MaxQDA,
allowing the labelling of text sections representing different themes or
ideas.
Categorization: The coded data were then categorized based on
shared themes or concepts, aiding comparison and analysis by reducing
the data volume.
Frequency and Keyword Analysis: The categorized data was then
subjected to frequency analysis, counting the recurrence of each category or code. Keyword analysis was also conducted, identifying the
data’s most used words or phrases. Both analyses provided insights into
prevalent themes and main discussion points.
These steps contributed to a deeper understanding of the drivers and
barriers of AI in SC by unveiling significant patterns from the expert
interviews.
Ethical Considerations were discussed upfront with the authors, and
all participants provided written informed consent before participating
in the interview. The video recordings are kept secured on SharePoint/
Microsoft Teams.
The list of interviewees can be found below:
The interview questions were formulated openly according to the
principles defined by Glaser ¨ and Laudel to ensure that all relevant data
was collected. The guidelines also ensured that the study did not harm
the interview partner by being structured based on these principles and
the critical question formulated. [14]
The interview questions were zorganized into five main categories,
each supported by more specific questions based on the answers. The
first category focused on the respondent’s background and their company’s overall strategy. The second category delved into the usage of AI
in the experts company. The third and fourth categories explored the
barriers and drivers of AI in the SC. The fifth and final category focused
on the future outlook and recommendations for other companies. Any
remaining questions were addressed at the end.
The interview protocol included formal greetings, openings, setting
the scene, clarifying questions and closings, which were not considered
part of the interview guide.
Twelve expert interviews were conducted and zanalyzed using
Mayring’s qualitative content analysis method, which is well-suited for
studying social issues, cultures, and circumstances. This method was
chosen because it is beneficial for investigating unknown phenomena,
perspectives, and experiences. The analysis involved both a verbal
communication analysis and a text analysis based on categories. Teams
were tasked with transcribing the interviews, which were then saved as
Microsoft Word files with numbered lines for precise referencing during
the analysis and presentation. This word-processing approach zprioritizes thematic information. [18]
The analysis considered pauses, filler words, and grammatical errors,
but they were not used in the final evaluation. [18] Each interview was
scheduled to last 60 min, with actual times ranging from 31 to 75 min
due to the flow of conversation and the amount of information shared.
The total length of all interviews was 512 min.
The content analysis process followed Mayring’s ten-step model,
which was applied before the final evaluation.
In addition to the qualitative interviews and statistical analysis, this
study employs MAXQDA, a data analysis software, to systematically
zanalyze the interview transcripts. The analysis comprehensively explains the experts’ perspectives on AI adoption in SCM by identifying
common words, similar recommendations, and recurring topics. This
analysis method ensures that the study captures the depth and nuances
of the expert opinions while maintaining a structured approach to data
interpretation.
MAXQDA’s powerful tools for coding and zanalyzing text data allow
the researchers to identify patterns, trends, and themes within the expert
interviews, which are then examined in the context of the study’s
broader objectives. This approach enables the researchers to uncover
valuable insights into AI drivers, barriers, and implications in SCM and
identify potential areas for future research and development.
Combining qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, and MAXQDAassisted transcript analysis, the study offers a full and thorough examination of the topic, effectively addressing the research questions and
achieving the paper’s objective.

4. Results
4.1. Summary of the conversations
Throughout twelve interviews, experts and industry leaders discussed the opportunities and challenges of implementing AI in SCM. The
interviews touched on various topics, from data management and algorithm accuracy to cultural differences and ethical considerations.
The experts illustrate the consensus on AI’s critical role in today’s
SCs. Digitization was unanimously recognized as a key component of
their business activities and as a foundation for implementing AI and
other advanced technologies.
The integration of AI into traditional SC processes has led to significant changes and offers opportunities for operational optimization and
efficiency gains. AI is used in various SC operations, such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, transport tracking, logistics optimization and customer service. The impact on daily operations is significant and mostly positive: it improves decision-making, increases
productivity and reduces operational costs. However, some negative
impacts have also been identified, such as the displacement of certain
roles, the challenge of managing complex AI systems, and the immense
costs of implementing and maintaining AI solutions.
In the context of industry-wide impacts, AI has ushered in a new era
of SC management that promotes innovation and competitiveness. It is
changing industry standards and expectations, and companies are
making significant financial commitments to remain competitive. The
budget allocated to AI varies from company to company, but the overarching trend means an escalation of AI-related investments. The
respondees agreed that in their company, a lot of the budget is associated with innovative AI projects even though it is often not named as
such.
The ethical use of AI has emerged as a priority concern, and
respondees companies have taken various measures to ensure responsible AI practices. For example, four respondees mentioned that establishing AI ethics policies, investing in employee training and setting up
oversight committees are action items in their companies. Social considerations were also identified as important elements, particularly
concerning relocation, privacy issues and the need for transparency in AI
decision-making processes.
One common theme that emerged throughout the interviews was the
importance of zdigitizing the SC to get the data. For SCM, in particular, it
is crucial not only to know the data within the company’s own four walls
but also to communicate with all partners in the SC to ensure a transparent exchange of information. However, it’s important to note that
what may appear to be AI may just be zoptimization through digitization, so transparency about what companies do with their data and algorithms is critical.
While AI can potentially bring significant value to specific use cases,
it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, the experts stressed the need
to first focus on improving processes and collaboration to ensure that
technology is supported by people rather than the other way around.
This includes breaking down silos between company departments to
improve communication and coordination and working together to find
solutions that benefit everyone involved. However, do not just break
down internal silos. Instead, involve all partners along the supply chain
to collaborate and share information.
As discussed in an interview, one significant potential use case for AI
in the SC is zoptimizing cargo loading on aeroplanes, container ships and
trucks. The interview highlighted the need for IT projects and tools to
replace manual processes and improve reporting and data management.
Using AI to zoptimize cargo space on vehicles can increase revenue and
save on costs. However, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered
and that the system is designed to allow for some degree of human input
and oversight is crucial.
While the potential benefits of AI are significant, the interviews also
touched on some of the challenges associated with its implementation.
One common barrier is the immaturity of processes and people and
insufficient data to zoptimize algorithms. Data quality and availability is
also key concern, as well as the cost of implementing AI solutions. Other
concerns, such as job displacement or lacking trust in the technology,
could also hinder adoption.
To overcome these barriers, the experts zemphasized the importance
of stakeholder collaboration. This includes sharing data and information
openly and transparently and breaking down silos between departments. It is also critical to approach AI implementation carefully,
focusing on data quality and management, human oversight and
transparency.
Throughout the interviews, the importance of zprioritizing people
over technology was a recurring theme. Rather than just zoptimizing for
efficiency and cost savings, companies should focus on building resilience and flexibility into the SC, and creating value for people and the
world. It’s also critical to ensure that AI-based solutions are ethical and
trustworthy, with control mechanisms to prevent incorrect decisions.
In conclusion, the interviews highlighted the potential of AI to bring
significant value to the SC and the importance of taking a structured and
cautious approach to its implementation. By zprioritizing collaboration,
data quality, and human oversight, companies can leverage AI to
improve their operations and create value for all stakeholders.
4.2. Drivers and barriers of AI
Based on the interviews, some of the main barriers to implementing
AI in SCM include:
One significant barrier to AI adoption in SCM is data quality and
connectivity. Data is often siloed and not easily accessible or standardized, making it difficult to gather all necessary information for optimal
decision-making. In addition, companies may face challenges integrating data from different sources, such as suppliers, customers, and
internal systems.
Resistance to change is another barrier to AI adoption in SCM.
Conservative industries and stakeholders may resist change, making
implementing new technologies and processes challenging. Companies
must work to overcome resistance by demonstrating the benefits of AI
and involving stakeholders early, even before the implementation process. The stakeholders should be part of the evaluation process and
discuss and vote for different solutions.
Lack of understanding and trust in AI is also a significant barrier to
adoption. Many people still do not fully understand what AI is and how it
can be used in SCM, which can lead to a lack of trust and resistance to
adoption. Companies must work to educate stakeholders on the benefits
of AI and build trust through transparent communication and explainable algorithms. In addition, AI is still often seen as a black box because
AI algorithms cannot explain the decision.
Integrating existing processes and workflows is another challenge in
implementing AI in SCM. AI needs to be integrated into existing processes and workflows, which can be complex and time-consuming.
Companies must ensure that the AI solution integrates with existing
systems and processes and does not disrupt operations.
Despite these barriers, there are several drivers for implementing AI
in SCM. One key driver has improved decision-making. AI can help
zoptimize SC processes and improve decision-making by zanalyzing
large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This can help companies
identify inefficiencies and make informed decisions to improve operations and reduce costs. The Interviews all aligned in one point. The
existing AI in SCM is not ready to decide without human supervision and
control.
Increased efficiency and cost savings are significant drivers for AI
adoption in SCM. By streamlining processes and identifying inefficiencies, AI can help companies save costs and increase efficiency.
This can also improve customer experience by enabling faster delivery
times and better product quality.
Another driver for AI adoption in SCM is a competitive advantage.

Companies that are early adopters of AI in SCM may gain a competitive
advantage over those that are slower to adopt. This can be achieved by
improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and providing a better
customer experience. One example here was the shipping industry. One
interviewee explained that they use an AI algorithm for loading aeroplanes. They use cameras to measure the dimensions of each package,
and the AI algorithms calculate the best load and load plan. In the past,
loadmasters had to calculate this with a very high effort because of the
various factors like dimensions, weights, stacking factors, dangerous
goods, regulations etc. Using AI makes this a task which will not last
more than a few minutes. However, again the loadmaster will always
ensure they select the best scenario.
In conclusion, companies must overcome several barriers to adoption
while focusing on the drivers for adoption to integrate AI successfully
into their SCM processes. By addressing challenges such as data quality
and connectivity, resistance to change, lack of understanding and trust
in AI, and integration with existing processes and workflows, companies
can harness the benefits of AI and gain a competitive advantage in the
market (see Table 3).
4.3. Recommendations for companies on how to implement AI in SCM
The interview explicitly asked for the experts’ recommendations for
companies implementing AI in SCM. Table 4 shows the recommendations in order of importance and the frequency with which this topic was
mentioned in a particular interview.
AI solutions can potentially zrevolutionize the SC by increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving decision-making. However, if
not executed properly, implementing AI solutions can be challenging
and have negative consequences, such as data breaches, lost revenue,
and job losses. Therefore, a structured and well-planned approach is
essential to ensure the successful implementation of AI in the SC. The
following are 14 steps that companies can take to ensure success when
implementing AI in the SC.
First, understand the current processes and identify pain points and
inefficiencies. This understanding will help identify areas where AI can
have the most significant impact. Then, once the current state is understood, define the goals and outcomes to be achieved with the new
solution. This will help measure success and ensure the solution meets
the company’s needs.
All stakeholders, including SC leaders, IT personnel, and end-users,
should be involved from the beginning to ensure that everyone is on
the same page and that the solution meets the needs of all parties
involved. Several interviewees mentioned the need to include, besides
the data scientist also, people who understand ethics and social considerations. There is a more significant need to have social scientists
included not only on the buying side but also on the software development side. Specific inputs may bias some algorithms.
All interviewees agreed that data quality and management should be
a priority, and the data used by the AI solution must be accurate, complete, and timely. Master data management is essential to ensure reliable
data ingestion, and companies should focus on it when implementing AI
solutions. Without good data, the AI solution cannot function correctly.

Therefore, a robust data management process is essential to ensure data
security and regulation compliance. SCM has a massive amount of data
through the involved partners like suppliers all the tiers down, transport
companies inbetween and the amount of transactions inbound and
outbound. However, this data is often not shared and unavailable in a
suitable format. Therefore, it is more important these days to think
about connectivity or using platforms to collaborate and share the data
in the correct format.
In addition, the AI solution should be continuously monitored and
evaluated to compare outcomes to goals and objectives. This will help
identify areas where the solution can be improved. For example, one
expert provided an interesting anecdote that illustrates a particular
challenge when using algorithms in the insurance industry. This
participant described a problem with an insurance policy calculation
algorithm where the result was inconsistent when the same person’s
data was processed multiple times in a single day.
To elaborate on the example, this participant’s company uses an
algorithm - a complex set of calculation instructions - to calculate individual insurance rates based on the data they provide. This data can
include a variety of factors such as age, health status, occupation, lifestyle habits, etc., which are typically used to assess an individual’s risk
profile and thus determine the cost of their insurance policy.
However, they discovered an unexpected and problematic behaviour
in their algorithm. When they used it to calculate the insurance rate for
the same person several times a day, the algorithm produced different
results each time. This inconsistency occurred even though the person’s
data remained the same. Ideally, the algorithm should give the same
result for the same input data, indicating a stable and reliable calculation. In this case, however, the fluctuating results of the algorithm
indicated a degree of unpredictability and instability in its calculations.
This inconsistency in the algorithm’s results poses a major challenge
for the insurance company. It undermines the fairness and reliability of
its insurance rate calculations, potentially leading to pricing discrepancies, dissatisfied customers and regulatory problems. Furthermore,
this sheds light on the broader issue of transparency and reliability of
algorithms, which is key in industries such as insurance that rely heavily
on data-driven decision-making.
Change management is crucial in ensuring the success of the AI solution. Developing a comprehensive change management plan will
manage resistance to change, which can hinder the success of the AI
solution.
Transparency, explainability, and trustworthiness are crucial to
building trust and addressing AI use concerns. This may also vary from a
cultural perspective. One interviewee made the experience that
depending on the region, the adoption of AI algorithms and the trust in
AI is different. Asian countries, through their extensive usage, do not
have as many concerns as European countries. American companies are
often open to new solutions with a failure culture, where trying and
failing is not a big concern. On the other hand, European companies are
hammering the fact of data protection and GDPR compliance.
Furthermore, zdemocratizing SC information can improve decisionmaking across all parties involved. Therefore, it is essential to work
towards zdemocratizing SC information. As mentioned beforehand, data
is the key to run the AI. Complex supply chains involve various partners.
Therefore, working together internally and externally with all chain
partners is crucial to run successful AI projects.
The AI solution should integrate with existing processes and workflows to ensure it is easy to use and does not disrupt operations. Several
interviewees mentioned that integration is very important and thinking
about platforms which enable internal and external connectivity. Still,
many big enterprises have a fragmented ERP structure with various
systems that are not communicating. In addition, the different partners
do not communicate in real-time. Instead, they still send each other
emails.
In addition, understanding the knowledge level of stakeholders
before proposing AI solutions is essential to ensure the solution is
appropriate for their level of knowledge. Nine out of twelve interviewees
mentioned the need to upskill people in the organization. Therefore,
there is a significant need for training on how to use AI.
Starting with small pilot projects before scaling up will help identify
and address issues before scaling up, ensuring the success of the AI solution. AI solutions can be very costly, and they are unsure if they bring
the success they promise. There is this twofold conversation between the
answers of the interviewees. Starting small and scaling up reduce the
initial investment, but on the other hand, there were comments that
algorithms can’t do the job accordingly without enough data.
The successful use of AI solutions depends not only on the technical
aspects but is also significantly influenced by the socio-cultural environment in which these solutions are implemented. Two respondees
mentioned that they had experienced cultural differences while implementing/selling AI solutions. This includes regional cultural differences
and the level of risk aversion that prevails in a particular society or
organization.
Regional cultural differences can strongly influence AI solutions’
perception, acceptance and use. For example, societies that value individual privacy are more sceptical of AI systems that require extensive
personal data. Similarly, there may be resistance to introducing AIdriven processes in cultures where traditional methods and human interactions are highly valued. Understanding and managing these cultural nuances is critical to successfully integrating and adopting AI
solutions. Risk aversion, another key factor, refers to a company or
society’s willingness to take risks associated with new technologies such
as AI. Companies with high-risk aversion may be slower to adopt AI
solutions because they fear potential negative impacts such as job losses,
privacy issues or unforeseen consequences of AI decisions.
Conversely, companies with lower risk aversion may be more likely
to adopt AI, betting on the potential for significant efficiency gains and
competitive advantage. In the face of these challenges, collaboration
between companies can greatly benefit. By sharing knowledge and resources, companies can collectively improve their understanding of AI
technologies, learn from others’ experiences and mitigate risks. This
could include sharing best practices for implementing AI solutions,
collaborating on AI research and development, or pooling resources to
invest in a common AI infrastructure. In addition, companies can better
address cultural and risk-related challenges through such collaboration
and ensure AI solutions’ successful and responsible adoption.
Implementing AI solutions in the SC can be challenging, but a
structured, well-planned approach can ensure success. By following the
14 steps mentioned above, companies can mitigate the risks of AI
implementation and enjoy the benefits it can bring.
4.4. Recommendations with points to avoid implementing AI
Implementing AI in the SC is not simple and requires careful
consideration to avoid pitfalls. The experts gave comments about
important points to avoid when implementing AI. The points in Table 5
are ranked by importance and how often this topic was mentioned by
experts. Here are some recommendations to avoid common mistakes
when implementing AI in the SC:
While AI can automate various tasks, it is essential to remember that
it is not a replacement for human intelligence. It is crucial to have
human oversight and intervention to ensure that the AI is making the
right decisions and to address any unexpected situations that may arise.
Companies should consider developing processes to enable humans to
intervene and make decisions based on their judgment and expertise.
Seven of the twelve experts mentioned that AI in SCM is far from making
autonomous decisions, and at least for the following years, this will stay
like this. Humans should be enabled to get options delivered by AI and
decide on one of them.
AI solutions rely heavily on data; if the data is of poor quality, the
results will also be poor. Therefore, companies should have a robust data
management process to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and
J. Hangl et al. 
Technology in Society 74 (2023) 102299
7
timely. In addition, establishing procedures to ensure that data is secure
and compliant with regulations is essential. One expert said that even
when data is the new gold and selling data is a business model, in SCM
this is not the appropriate way. All SC contributors should share their
data transparently for better overall benefits. Companies should not just
look for their benefits because this can cause disruptions upstream or
downstream. This is also part of different private and public policies.
One example is the Nordic national public policy strategies for AI, which
recommend that sharing data doesn’t reduce its availability but can
increase its value when combined with other datasets, offering new insights or enabling innovative uses. [19]
Each SC has unique challenges, so understanding them before
implementing AI solutions is crucial. In addition, companies should
evaluate their specific SC processes, identify inefficiencies and pain
points, and develop AI solutions to address these issues. An example is
algorithms for business planning. Depending on the industry specifics,
the algorithms need to be tuned to fulfil the requirements for the specific
use cases.
SCM involves various stakeholders, including suppliers, customers,
and internal teams. It is essential to involve all stakeholders from the
beginning to ensure that everyone is on board and understands the goals
and benefits of the new solution. This will also help get the team’s buy-in
and reduce resistance to change.
Transparency and explainability are critical components in building
trust in AI decision-making. Therefore, companies should ensure that AI
solutions provide clear explanations for their decision-making processes, and they should also provide a transparent view of the data used.
This will help stakeholders understand how the AI is working and build
trust in its decision-making capabilities.
Companies should start with small pilot projects to test the feasibility
and effectiveness of AI solutions before scaling up. This will help identify
potential issues and challenges early on and develop solutions to them.
Companies should ensure that their AI solutions comply with relevant regulations and guidelines. This includes data privacy regulations
and regulations related to the use of AI in decision-making processes. In
addition, AI solutions involve processing sensitive data, and ensuring
that data is secure and protected from cyber threats is essential.
Therefore, companies should consider implementing cybersecurity
measures to protect their data and ensure data privacy.
AI solutions require zspecialized skills, and companies should provide training and upskilling opportunities to employees to ensure they
have the necessary skills to work with AI tools and solutions. This will
help ensure that employees can use AI solutions effectively and efficiently. All interviewees stated that educating the employees and
adopting new skills will be crucial to all companies. Highly educated
employees will know how to use AI wisely and correctly but still help
improve the company further. Especially social skills should be trained.
As AI begins a new technological revolution, companies need to copy
governments’ efforts during past industrial transformations. Similar to
how countries like the US, Germany and Sweden have retrained their
populations, companies should offer their employees AI-specific training
and development opportunities. The successful integration of AI into
companies requires a balance between technical training and human
elements, with both technical and soft skills being important. [20]
AI solutions have limitations, and companies should not assume that
AI will solve all SC problems. Therefore, it is essential to consider the
specific context and limitations of the SC when implementing or utilizing AI.
5. Discussion
zzImplementing AI in SCM has proven to be a game changer for the
industry as it promises improvements in efficiency, decision making and
cost reduction. These benefits offer businesses a competitive advantage.
However, a smooth transition to an AI-integrated SCM environment is
not without significant challenges.
The research identifies several barriers to successful AI integration:
data quality and management, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and trust in AI topping the list. These issues require a
comprehensive and robust AI implementation strategy underlined by
broad stakeholder engagement throughout the process. In addition,
active stakeholder engagement can provide valuable insights for companies to align AI adoption with SCM goals and operational realities.
Resistance to change can be combated by fostering trust in AI
through education about the technology and its benefits, combined with
transparent communication strategies. Our study also highlights the
benefits of pilot projects that demonstrate the effective integration of AI
in controlled, smaller environments before they are rolled out on a large
scale. Such projects can dispel misconceptions about the technology,
reducing fears and misunderstandings.
The critical role of data quality in AI implementation became clear in
our research. AI technologies are essentially only as effective as the data
they process. Therefore, companies must ensure that their AI data is
accurate, accessible, standardized and comes from various sources,
including suppliers, customers and internal systems.
Transparency and explainability of AI decision-making processes are
other important findings. So often, AI algorithms operate as “black
boxes”, and their decision-making processes are hidden or ununderstandable. This opacity can lead to trust issues between stakeholders,
which can hinder AI adoption. Therefore, companies should focus on
developing AI systems with built-in transparency and explainability to
circumvent such problems.
In addition, the ethical aspects of AI in SCM deserve special attention. The displacement of jobs through automation, the need to upskill

employees and the creation of ethical AI policies have emerged as critical issues that require further research and thoughtful policy decisions.
It is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of our
research, as our findings come from a relatively small sample of expert
interviews. Interpretation of the results should consider the inherent
biases of the experts interviewed and the potential limitations of selfreporting. Despite these limitations, our study provides a valuable
foundation for future research on AI implementation in SCM.
Furthermore, the experts emphasized that AI is a tool, not a substitute for human expertise. While it can automate various tasks, successful
integration requires processes that allow for human intervention and use
human judgement.
Before implementing AI, it is important to understand the specific
needs and challenges of each SCM. Each SCM has unique characteristics
that require assessing current processes, identifying inefficiencies and
developing AI solutions tailored to address these issues.
Integrating AI into SCM requires careful planning, human oversight,
comprehensive data management, stakeholder engagement and a
transparent, ethical approach. By following these expert recommendations, companies can navigate the complex path to AI adoption, overcome resistance and secure a competitive advantage through improved
operational efficiency and innovative decision-making. Pilot projects,
regulatory compliance and employee training, are other elements to
consider for a successful transition.
In summary, while challenging, the path to AI integration in SCM
holds great promise for companies seeking greater efficiency and
competitiveness. A holistic view that includes all stakeholders focuses
on data quality, ensures transparency and considers ethical considerations is essential for success.
6. Limitations and implications
Expert interviews are widely used for collecting qualitative data in
research studies. However, despite their popularity, it is crucial to
acknowledge the limitations of this method to ensure the validity and
reliability of the results.
One of the main limitations of expert interviews is self-reported data.
Participants’ responses are based on their perceptions and recollections
of events and experiences, which may not always be accurate.
Furthermore, experts may have a biased perspective on their field and
present information supporting their views.
Another limitation of expert interviews is the limited sample size.
The sample size in expert interviews is often small, which can limit the
generalizability of the results. Additionally, the researcher has limited
control over variables such as the order in which questions are answered
and the level of detail the participant provides.
Expert interviews can also be time-consuming and may restrict the
number of participants who can be interviewed. Moreover, expert interviews may be limited by the availability of the expert, who may have
other obligations.
The unstructured nature of expert interviews can also lead to a lack
of standardization, which may impact the validity and reliability of the
results.
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, using AI in SCM can zrevolutionize the industry by
improving efficiency, productivity, decision-making, and customer
satisfaction while reducing costs and waste. However, the implementation of AI in the SC is not a simple process, and there are several
challenges and potential pitfalls that companies need to overcome to
ensure success.
The experts interviewed in this study highlighted several drivers and
barriers to adopting AI in SCM, as well as recommendations for companies on implementing AI in SCM and avoiding common mistakes.
Critical drivers for adoption include improved decision-making,
increased efficiency and cost savings, and competitive advantage.
Conversely, key barriers to adoption include resistance to change, data
quality and management issues, and difficulty integrating AI with
existing processes and workflows.
To successfully implement AI in the SC, companies should take a
structured and well-planned approach that involves all stakeholders
from the beginning, zprioritizes data quality and management, focuses
on transparency and explainability, and considers regional cultural
differences and the importance of ethics and sustainability.
While challenges and potential pitfalls are associated with implementing AI in the SC, the benefits it can bring are significant. By carefully considering the recommendations and insights from experts,
companies can successfully adopt and implement AI solutions that can
transform their SC processes and help them gain a competitive advantage in the market.
