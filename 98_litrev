# Literature Review: Cybersecurity Threats in FinTech: A Systematic Review

## Introduction

The rapid evolution of the Smart-everything movement and Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have
given rise to sophisticated cyber threats that traditional methods are struggling to address. In the context
of Financial Technology (FinTech), where sensitive financial information is exchanged electronically, the
need for robust cybersecurity measures is paramount. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of research on cybersecurity threats in FinTech. By integrating and
synthesizing the provided research findings, this review will identify key insights, highlight knowledge
gaps, and suggest potential future research directions.

## Methodology

To conduct this literature review, a systematic approach was adopted to identify relevant research articles.
A search was conducted using various databases, including IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar,
using keywords such as "cybersecurity threats," "FinTech," and "systematic review." The inclusion criteria
for selecting articles were that they focused specifically on cybersecurity threats in the FinTech domain
and were published within the last five years. After applying these criteria, a total of 14 research articles
were selected for analysis.

## Analysis and Synthesis

The selected research articles provide valuable insights into different aspects of cybersecurity threats in
FinTech. The findings from these studies can be categorized into four main themes: healthcare, artificial
intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and social engineering. Each theme is discussed in detail below.

### Healthcare

One of the key findings in the literature is the increasing cybersecurity threats in the healthcare sector.
Kruse et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review of modern threats and trends in healthcare cybersecurity.
They identified various types of cyber-attacks, such as ransomware, phishing, and data breaches, that
pose significant risks to the confidentiality and integrity of healthcare data. This demonstrates the need
for robust cybersecurity measures in the FinTech industry, where sensitive financial information is also at

risk (Kruse et al., 2017).

### Artificial Intelligence

The intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) is another important area of research.
Li (2018) conducted a survey to explore the relationship between cybersecurity and AI. The study
highlighted the potential of AI in enhancing cybersecurity measures, such as anomaly detection, threat
intelligence, and incident response. However, it also pointed out the challenges associated with AI in terms
of adversarial attacks and privacy concerns. This suggests that further research is needed to address these
challenges and leverage the full potential of AI in FinTech cybersecurity (Li, 2018).

### Internet of Things

The internet of things (IoT) is another domain that is susceptible to cybersecurity threats. Abdullahi et al.
(2022) conducted a systematic literature review to identify cybersecurity attacks in IoT and the role of
artificial intelligence in detecting and mitigating these attacks. The study highlighted the vulnerabilities
of IoT devices and the need for AI-based methods to detect and prevent cyber-attacks. This finding is
significant for the FinTech industry, as IoT devices are commonly used in financial transactions and data
exchange (Abdullahi et al., 2022).

### Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks are a prevalent cybersecurity threat in various domains, including FinTech. Hijji
and Alam (2021) conducted a multivocal literature review to explore the growing social engineering-based
cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlighted the challenges and prospective
solutions to mitigate social engineering attacks. This finding emphasizes the need for user awareness and
education in the FinTech industry to prevent social engineering attacks (Hijji & Alam, 2021).

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Although the selected research articles provide valuable insights into cybersecurity threats in FinTech,
there are still some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need for more research
on the specific types of cyber-attacks targeting the FinTech industry. While some studies have explored
general cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and social engineering, more research is needed to
understand the unique challenges faced by the FinTech sector.
Secondly, there is a lack of research on the impact of cybersecurity threats on the business sustainability

of FinTech companies. Understanding the financial and reputational consequences of cyber-attacks can
help organizations develop effective risk management strategies.
Furthermore, the integration of AI in cybersecurity is a promising area for future research. While some
studies have explored the potential of AI in enhancing cybersecurity measures, further research is needed
to address the challenges associated with AI, such as adversarial attacks and privacy concerns.
Lastly, the role of regulatory frameworks and legal mechanisms in mitigating cybersecurity threats in
FinTech requires further investigation. Understanding the legal and regulatory landscape can help policymakers and industry stakeholders develop effective strategies to protect sensitive financial information.
In conclusion, this literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of research
on cybersecurity threats in FinTech. The findings highlight the importance of addressing cybersecurity
challenges in the healthcare sector, leveraging AI in cybersecurity measures, securing IoT devices, and
mitigating social engineering attacks. However, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed,
such as understanding specific cyber-attacks in the FinTech industry, assessing the impact on business
sustainability, further exploring AI integration, and investigating legal and regulatory frameworks. Future
research in these areas can contribute to the development of robust cybersecurity measures in the FinTech
industry.
