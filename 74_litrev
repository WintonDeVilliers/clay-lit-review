# Literature Review: The Cyber Threat Landscape in South Africa: A 10-Year Review

## Introduction

The rise in cyber-related incidents globally has become a significant concern as information technology
improves and reliance on technology increases. South Africa is not immune to the effects of this evolving
cyber threat landscape. This literature review aims to review the findings from an evaluation of South
Africa's cyber threat landscape over a 10-year period, from 2010 to 2020. The analysis of 74 cyber
incidents that occurred during this period provides insights into the nature and impact of cyber threats
in South Africa.

## Cyber Threat Intelligence and Analysis

To effectively understand and mitigate cyber threats, it is crucial to have comprehensive cyber threat
intelligence (CTI) and analysis capabilities. Liao et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of automatic
discovery and analysis of open-source CTI to improve the identification and response to cyber threats.
This approach enables organizations to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities in their
systems.

## Taxonomy of Cyber-Harms

Understanding the impacts of cyber-attacks is essential in assessing the severity and consequences of cyber
threats. Agrafiotis et al. (2018) propose a taxonomy of cyber-harms that defines the different impacts of
cyber-attacks. This taxonomy helps in categorizing and analyzing the effects of cyber incidents, providing
insights into the potential risks and vulnerabilities faced by organizations in South Africa.

## Cyber Threat Intelligence Challenges

Despite the importance of cyber threat intelligence, there are challenges in effectively implementing and
utilizing it. Abu et al. (2018) highlight the issues and challenges related to cyber threat intelligence,
emphasizing the need for improved strategies and frameworks to address these challenges. Understanding
these challenges is crucial for developing effective cybersecurity measures in South Africa.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the reviewed articles provide valuable insights into various aspects of the cyber threat landscape in
South Africa, there are still some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed.
Firstly, there is a need for further research on the specific types of cyber threats prevalent in South Africa.

Understanding the nature and characteristics of these threats can help organizations develop targeted
strategies for prevention and mitigation.
Secondly, the impact of cyber threats on critical infrastructure in South Africa requires further investigation. Assessing the vulnerabilities and potential consequences of cyber-attacks on vital sectors such as
energy, transportation, and healthcare is essential for ensuring the resilience of these infrastructures.
Thirdly, research should focus on the evolving tactics and techniques employed by cybercriminals in South
Africa. Staying up-to-date with the latest trends in cyber-attacks can help organizations better prepare and
respond to emerging threats.
Lastly, there is a need for studies that explore the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures and best
practices in South African organizations. Evaluating the implementation and outcomes of cybersecurity
strategies can provide valuable insights and inform future policies and guidelines.

## Conclusion

This literature review provides an overview of the cyber threat landscape in South Africa based on the
analysis of 74 cyber incidents from 2010 to 2020. The integration and synthesis of the provided research
findings highlight the importance of cyber threat intelligence, the taxonomy of cyber-harms, and the
challenges associated with cyber threat intelligence. Furthermore, the review identifies knowledge gaps
and suggests potential future research directions, including the investigation of specific cyber threats, the
impact on critical infrastructure, the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, and the evaluation of cybersecurity
measures. Addressing these gaps will contribute to a better understanding of the cyber threat landscape
in South Africa and the development of effective cybersecurity strategies.
