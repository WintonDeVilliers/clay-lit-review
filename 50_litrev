# Literature Review: The Barriers to Sustainable Risk Transfer in the Cyber-Insurance Market

## Introduction

Efficient risk transfer is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of any market, including the cyber-insurance
market. However, the constantly evolving nature of cyber-threats and the lack of public data sharing
pose significant barriers to achieving efficient risk transfer in this market. This literature review aims to
synthesize the research findings on the barriers to sustainable risk transfer in the cyber-insurance market
and identify potential future research directions.

## Evolving Nature of Cyber-Threats and Lack of Public Data Sharing

The constantly evolving nature of cyber-threats and the lack of public data sharing greatly impede the
achievement of economic conditions necessary for efficient cyber-insurance premiums. Amoore (2013)
highlights that without access to comprehensive and up-to-date information on cyber-threats, it is highly
unlikely for insurers to accurately price the risk, resulting in inefficient premiums. The lack of public data
sharing exacerbates this issue, as insurers struggle to obtain the necessary data to assess and underwrite
cyber risks effectively (Biener, Eling, & Wirfs, 2015).

## Distinct Characteristics of Cyber Risks

Biener et al. (2015) argue that cyber risks possess distinct characteristics compared to other operational
risks. These characteristics, such as highly interrelated losses, lack of data, and severe information
asymmetries, create significant problems that hinder the development of a sustainable cyber insurance
market. The interrelated nature of cyber losses makes it challenging for insurers to accurately estimate
the potential magnitude of losses and develop appropriate coverage and pricing strategies. Additionally,
the lack of reliable and centralized incident reporting further compounds the information asymmetries
between insurers and insured parties, limiting the availability of accurate risk data (Biener et al., 2015).

## Failure of Private Market in Providing Optimal Cybersecurity

Saleh (2012) highlights that despite increasing risk awareness and active cyber risk management by firms,
the private market often fails to provide the socially optimal level of cybersecurity. This failure can be
attributed to various factors, including market inefficiencies and systemic cyber risk interactions with
other financial stability risks. The private market's inability to adequately address cyber risks underscores
the need for effective risk transfer mechanisms, such as cyber liability insurance policies, to mitigate the
potential financial impact of cyber incidents (Saleh, 2012).

## Lack of Understanding and Pricing Mechanisms in Cyber Insurance

The rapid growth of the cyber insurance market in recent years has not been accompanied by a comprehensive understanding of the policies and mechanisms behind risk assessments. Kopp, Kaffenberger,
and Wilson (2017) argue that this lack of knowledge hinders the development of sustainable risk transfer
in the cyber-insurance market. Through their analysis of cyber insurance policies, they provide valuable
insights into the underwriting process and shed light on how insurance companies understand and price
cyber risks. This research contributes to filling the knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms that
drive risk assessments in cyber insurance (Kopp et al., 2017).

## Profit Opportunities and Security Pre-Screening

Paudel (2012) suggests that security interdependency in the absence of insurance creates profit opportunities for insurers. When interdependent agents do not account for risk externalities due to the lack of
insurance, insurers can design appropriate contracts that incentivize agents to increase their effort levels,
thereby mitigating risks. Additionally, security pre-screening allows insurers to take advantage of this
profit opportunity by offering commitment to interdependent agents through appropriate contracts. This
approach not only facilitates risk transfer but also encourages agents to enhance their security efforts
(Paudel, 2012).

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

Despite the valuable insights provided by the existing research, several knowledge gaps remain in
understanding the barriers to sustainable risk transfer in the cyber-insurance market. Future research
should focus on addressing the following areas:

1. **Data Sharing and Standardization:** Further investigation is needed to explore mechanisms for
   improving data sharing and standardization in the cyber-insurance market. This could involve the establishment of centralized incident reporting systems and the development of standardized risk assessment
   frameworks.
2. **Modeling Dynamic Cyber-Threats:** Given the dynamic nature of cyber-threats, future research
   should focus on developing models that capture the evolving risk landscape. These models could incorporate real-time threat intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance risk assessment and pricing
   accuracy.
3. **Regulatory Frameworks:** Research is needed to examine the role of regulatory frameworks in
   facilitating sustainable risk transfer in the cyber-insurance market. This could involve analyzing the effectiveness of existing regulations and proposing policy recommendations to address market inefficiencies
   and promote risk sharing.
   In conclusion, the barriers to sustainable risk transfer in the cyber-insurance market arise from the

   constantly evolving nature of cyber-threats, lack of public data sharing, distinct characteristics of cyber
   risks, failure of the private market, and limited understanding of pricing mechanisms. Future research
   should focus on addressing these barriers and filling the knowledge gaps to facilitate the development of
   a sustainable and efficient cyber-insurance market.
