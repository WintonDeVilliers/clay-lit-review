ABSTRACT
Organisations are benefiting from the use of emerging digital technologies for
improved efficiencies. These technologies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks
resulting in breaches on organisational assets. Cyber-attacks necessitates
boards and top management to strategically rethink their cybersecurity
approaches to managing cyber risks. The purpose of the study was to explore
the factors influencing cyber insurance adoption in the South African industry.
The study adapted Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) theoretical
framework to investigate cyber insurance adoption relevant to the South African
context. The review of literature focused on the cybersecurity, cyber risk
management, and cyber insurance phenomenon to understand the global and
developing world landscape. The research design followed the systemic
collection of qualitative data through semi-structured interview questions on the
purposefully selected sample of professionals in the public and private sectors of
the South African industry. The analysis and interpretation through categorisation
of patterns of data collected enabled presentation and discussion of emerging
themes resulting in findings. The key findings relate to effective cybersecurity
awareness, organisational approach to managing cyber risks, as well as the
nature of industry and compliance with legislation. The study established that the
combination of effective cybersecurity awareness, the relationship between the
strategic organisational approach to cybersecurity and top management support
towards cyber risk management as well as compliance with legislation are the
factors influencing cyber insurance adoption in the South African industry. In
order to meet the research objectives, various conclusions were made. The study
concluded that effective cybersecurity awareness must be viewed as a strategic
imperative to enable organisations to operate securely. The study also concluded
that organisations must proactively approach cybersecurity strategically thereby
ensuring effective top management buy-in. The study concluded that the POPI
Act is the primary driver of cyber insurance adoption in the South African industry.
KEY WORDS
Cybersecurity, cyber risk, cyber insurance, cybercrime, cyber-attack.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces the research study to investigate factors influencing
cyber insurance adoption in South Africa. The purpose and significance of the
study are elucidated and contextualised in the public and private sectors of the
South African industry. The research problem is unpacked in detail thus leading
to research objectives. Key constructs that are out of the scope of this study are
discussed in this chapter. The study investigates individuals that are positioned
at strategic, tactical and operational levels in organisations. These levels are
operationalised through organisational cross cutting constructs such as
technology, processes and sytems to drive organisational objectives.
1.1 Purpose of the study
The origin of the cyber insurance market can be traced back to the 1970s from
the technology risk or technology errors and omissions (E&O) (Camillo, 2017).
All industries, public and private, are susceptible to cyber risks (Kopp,
Kaffenberger, & Jenkinson, 2017). This has resulted in the elevation of
cybersecurity’s importance and visibility to the highest levels of organisations
wherein the executives and boards perceive it as a strategic imperative Kopp et
al. (2017). This suggests that executives are cognisant of the impact of the lack
of sound cybersecurity practices within organisations. Thus, the consistent
increase in cyber-attacks is developing awareness for cyber insurance to provide
relief in the event the organisation is attacked (Toregas & Zahn, 2014).
Completely eliminating cybersecurity risks is a challenging task albeit the latest
cybersecurity defence technologies and implementing security policies to
mitigate the likelihood of a cybersecurity breach (Tabansky, 2017). This suggests
that no matter how strong the protection technology and security practices are,
there is a possibility that an intruder can gain access to the company’s systems
and data assets. Also, there may be gaps in terms of internal employee skillset
as well as cybersecurity levels of awareness which usually lags sophisticated
intruders (Addington & Manrod, 2019). Generally, this reality is particularly
prevalent in most organisations due to lack of resources and capabilities to 
13
effectively deal with cyber risks (Sommerrock, Madnick, Siegel, Pulido, Coden,
Bartol, & Bernaski, 2018).
In addition, residual cybersecurity risks cannot be entirely mitigated through the
deployment of technical controls only (Rohmeyer & Bayuk, 2019). As such,
sound cyber resilience is achieved through a combination of technical,
procedural, financial and human interventions (Toregas & Zahn, 2014). Cyber
insurance fills the gaps left by inadequate technology, skills, and effective levels
of cybersecurity awareness to enhance cyber resilience (Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2016).
Therefore, the desired outcome of this study was to scrutinise the factors
influencing cyber insurance adoption in both the public and private sectors of the
South African industry.
1.2 Context of the study
Cybersecurity breaches are growing at exponential rates and organisations are
seeking to explore methods to lower the effect of cybersecurity breaches
(Addington & Manrod, 2019). The advent of increasing internet penetration
fuelled by mobile devices, protecting organisational assets such as data,
systems, applications, and intellectual property becomes elevated on the
Information Technology (IT) and business executives agenda (ISACA, 2016). In
2017, it was estimated that there is 20.35 billion connected Internet of Things
(IoT) devices and the figure is likely to increase (Silva et al., 2019). Mitigating the
risk that emanates from such connectivity is becoming an overwhelming duty for
most Cyber Security professionals as the threat landscape has intensified
significantly (IDC, 2018).
Most organisations are digitalising their operations to take advantage of the 4th
industrial revolution (4IR) that has a potential to expose the organisation to
hacking if cybersecurity risk is inadequately managed (Leitner & Stiefmueller,
2019). According to an IBM study conducted on 477 organisations in 13 different
countries including 2634 individuals, it was estimated that the average cost of a
data breach could exceed $3.86 million by 2019.
14
Furthermore, the introduction of regulations such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) for South African organisations operating in the European
Union (GDPR, 2019) and more specifically in the context of South Africa, the
Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), becomes the drivers for
enhanced cybersecurity posture for organisations (POPIA, 2013). This is due to
stringent rules that emanate from the aforementioned regulations to secure data.
A breach of IT systems could result in lasting reputational damage, revenue loss,
and fines to the organisation of any size (ISACA, 2016). Customers could also
sue companies in the event their personal information is accessed by an
unauthorised party during the breach (North & Pascoe, 2016). Cybersecurity
attacks have become sophisticated and therefore require a different approach to
mitigating cyber risks (Camillo, 2017). Thus, over and above implementing
technical controls, companies must explore cyber insurance to enhance cyber
resilience to systems and data (Kesan & Hayes, 2017).
Whilst cyber insurance is not a silver bullet or replacement for improved
cybersecurity from people, process and technology perspective; skills, training,
policies, and procedures, as well as technology, are still required (Sommerrock
et al., 2018). Therefore, cyber insurance can provide a financial shield to ensure
operations are resumed speedily post cyber breach in the South African industry.
1.3 Research problem
Cybersecurity is a topical issue at the board level due to the impact it has on the
reputation and therefore sustainability of the business of any size (ISACA, 2016).
The absence of a systemic approach to cyber defence that takes into account the
use of best practice frameworks, internal controls, cyber risk management and
understanding of ever-changing cybersecurity landscape can be a challenge to
organisations (Kshetri, 2015b). Coordination efforts to mitigate cyber threats such
as the inability to access critical business systems, unauthorised modification of
data as well unavailability of systems is required (Skopik et al., 2016).
Cybersecurity threats can be exploited as a result of unpatched machines, weak
passwords, and lack of periodic antimalware updates (Süzen, 2020) as well as 
15
employee negligence or failure to backup mission-critical systems (Nikolov &
Slavyanov, 2018). Cyber-attacks such as ransomware, brute-force, and denial of
service and leakage/loss of sensitive information by employees who have access
to data could result in revenue loss, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and
penalties as well as customer ligation suits (Tabansky, 2017).
To ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information assets and
in light of the rising cyber-attacks, companies must consider adding cyber
insurance to mitigate against cyber risks (Sommerrock et al., 2018). Therefore,
what are the factors influencing cyber insurance adoption in South Africa
industry?
1.4 Research objectives
The objective of this research is to investigate factors influencing cyber insurance
adoption in South Africa industry from the perspective:
i. Technology about the awareness and
effectiveness of cybersecurity technologies.
ii. Organisation about cyber risk management and
management support.
iii. Environment about government regulations and
the nature of the industry.
1.5 Significance of the study
Cyber insurance is a growing industry in developed markets such as the United
States (US) and European Union (EU) (N. Shetty et al., 2010; Wang, 2019). The
significance of the study is to identify factors pertinent to the adoption of cyber
insurance within the South African industry context. Due to the criticality of sound
cyber resilient practices for South African organisations, cyber insurance can be
an added layer of cyber risk management that ensures sustainability (Huang et
al., 2018).
16
Cyber insurance enables organisations to focus on key strategic objectives such
as increased revenue, customer satisfaction, and compliance with applicable
laws thereby contributing to the long term viability of the organisation (Brangetto
& Aubyn, 2015). However, investment in cyber insurance does not translate to
revenue generation or growth for an organisation (Camillo, 2017). The customer
concerns with privacy and the introduction of legislation regulating the security of
customer data is no longer a nice to have for organisations (King & Raja, 2012),
it is a regulatory requirement (GDPR, 2019; POPIA, 2013).
Management of cyber risks can improve organisational performance and improve
compliance with internal processes as well as external legislative and regulatory
frameworks for improved cybersecurity posture (Contreras et al., 2012; Daud et
al., 2018). Due diligence becomes management’s main concern in ensuring
reasonable cybersecurity by firms of all sizes (Brangetto & Aubyn, 2015).
In the developing world, cyber insurance has proven to enhance value to
business by ensuring the swift resumption of operations albeit, at a higher cost,
which lowers the demand for adoption (Kshetri, 2015b). Therefore, the study will
add local findings to the pool of existing knowledge on the factors influencing the
adoption of cyber insurance in the South African industry. As such, relationships
between cybersecurity, cyber risk management, and cyber insurance concepts
are explored to ground the study into the South African context.
1.6 Delimitations of the study
The research study will focus on organisations that operate in the South African
industry both public and private sectors. The study will consider employees in the
strategic, tactical and operational levels to ascertain their views and experiences
on cyber insurance phenomenon. The study will exclude the following aspects:
a) Cyber insurance premium calculations
b) Cyber risk modelling
c) Accumulation risk
d) Insurability of organisations
e) Cyber insurance modelling 
17
f) Cyber insurance pricing
g) Quantification of the value cyber attacks
1.7 Definition of terms
Cyber insurance refers to insurance contracts designed to mitigate liability
issues, property loss and theft, data damage, loss of income from network outage
and computer failures, Web-site defacement, and cyber extortion
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009).
Cyber risks are defined as operational risks to information and technology assets
that have consequences affecting the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of
information or information systems (Eling & Wirfs, 2015).
Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security
safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best
practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber
environment and organization and user’s assets (R. von Solms & van Niekerk,
2013, p. 1).
Vulnerability refers to weak points that are built-in properties of a defined system
(Tabansky, 2011).
1.8 Assumptions
The research made the following assumptions:
a) Participants will be available and co-operate to ensure that the research
study is complete.
b) Participants will provide relevant perspectives based on their
understanding of the concepts.
c) Participants have an understanding of cybersecurity, cyber risk, and cyber
insurance.
d) Participants will answer diligently to enrich the generation of knowledge
through their industry experience.
18
e) Participants work in the South African industry for both the public and
private sectors.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
The previous chapter (Chapter 1) provided a high-level purpose, context, and
significance of the study by identifying a problem and objectives to the study
about the adoption of cyber insurance in the South African industry. Chapter 2
reviews the literature that underpins the study in terms of linkage between
cybersecurity and emerging digital technologies. This chapter provides a brief
background and explores the causes of cybersecurity incidents that have a
significant impact on businesses. The exploration of the TechnologyOrganisation-Environment (TOE) theoretical framework forms the basis upon
which this study is based to elucidate emerging factors leading to the first
proposition.
Furthermore, the introduction of the concept of cyber risk management with a
particular focus on the South African and developing world context is unpacked
in detail. The study then makes a second proposition that attempts to bring to
light the potential benefits of a proactive cyber-risk management approach.
Finally, the study delves into the cyber insurance market, various types of cyber
insurance covers, the drivers and challenges that have an impact on the adoption
of cyber insurance. The third proposition emerges and explores the impact of the
operating environment on cyber insurance adoption in South Africa.
2.2 Background
Globally, cybersecurity is inevitably receiving the attention as it is considered a
different method of warfare (de Bruijn & Janssen, 2017) which necessitates the
organisation to search for sustainable countermeasures (Goode, 2018; Von
Solms & Van Niekerk, 2013) and any business operation can be impacted
negatively (Costa et al., 2019). According to Vicevich (2018, p. 9), “cybersecurity
is national security” and comprises different aspects that are complex, ranging
from legal and legislative issues, global threat actors, and different types of cyber 
20
threats. Threat actors include but not limited to script kiddies, competitors, nationstates, terrorists, employees, customers criminals or malicious hackers (Aloul, AlAli, Al-Dalky, Al-Mardini, & El-Hajj, 2012).
The objective of cybersecurity is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of systems, data and assets (R. von Solms & van Niekerk, 2013). The
view is similar to the ISO 27000 standard. International Organisation for
Standardisation is the world-renowned entity that publishes and develops
standards and best practice frameworks (‘ISO - International Organization for
Standardization’, 2019). The ISO 27000 series contains guidelines and controls
for organisations to manage their cybersecurity risk programmes (Herr, 2019).
According to Von Solms & van Niekerk (2013), cybersecurity is premised on
protecting assets from a range of threats posed by vulnerabilities as illustrated in
Figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Cybersecurity Adapted from (R. von Solms & van Niekerk, 2013)
Figure 1 above indicate that there are various threats due to vulnerabilities of
systems, data, and technology that are likely to affect organisational assets,
human and their interest negatively if they are not managed properly. As such,
threats can emanate both from internal and external because of vulnerabilities
inherently on technology, software, and hardware. Such vulnerabilities may
negatively affect organisational assets thus must be secured.
Cyberspace has the potential to provide human-kind with benefits that
meaningfully improve the quality of life but has various unknown risks that if they
are not addressed could result in security incidents (Tabansky, 2017). A security
incident is defined as a set of security events linked with a multitude of potentially
concerted network activities that merit special consideration by the network
administrator (Ab Rahman & Choo, 2015).

2.3 The Technology Organisation Environment Framework
The Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework describes the
process by which a firm adopts and implements innovations in the technological,
organizational, and environmental contexts (Tornatzky et al., 1990). According
to Bandyopadhyay (2012a), the Technology Organization Environment (TOE)
framework of (Tornatzky et al., 1990) is appropriate for an adequate model of
adoption of cyber insurance. Figure 2 below illustrates an adapted TOE
framework that underpins this study. Furthermore, it is stated that “a model for
adoption and utilization of cyber insurance must fundamentally include the factors
that affect the perceived valuation of cyber insurance as an instrument to manage
cyber risk in the organization” (Bandyopadhyay, 2012a, p. 3).

As depicted in figure 2 above, the study will be underpinned by technological,
organisational and environmental factors to ascertain the inclination of South
African firms to make decisions on cyber insurance adoption as a means to
transfer cyber risk to a third party insurer. Cyber insurance adoption in
conjunction with the existing cybersecurity controls delivers maximum value for
the organisation (Woods & Simpson, 2017).
In the technology context, the study will ascertain whether the company has
cybersecurity technologies deployed, how effective it is and how dependent is the
organisation on the technology to mitigate against cyber threats. The organisation
context explores the risk appetite to determine the extent to which the
organisation approaches risk management from an integrated point of view. The
study determines the extent of the availability of financial resources to support
cybersecurity initiatives to manage cyber risk. Finally, the environmental context
considers the extent to which regulatory needs, nature of business and
communities of interests play a role in the cyber insurance decision-making.
2.4 Linking cybersecurity to digital technology
The growing reliance on digital technologies, while creating significant
opportunities for innovation, convenience, and efficiency, comes with digital
security and privacy protection risks (OECD, 2018). There is consistency with
Toregas & Zahn (2014) view that the losses incurred from cyber-attacks are
growing as new technologies spread and reliance on technology increases. The
spread of new technologies such as Cloud computing, mobile devices, and social
media increases vulnerability to cyber-attacks (Toregas & Zahn, 2014).
Cybersecurity risks are likely to significantly increase business processes
become automated, IT assets becoming acquired and businesses placing
reliance on IT to achieve their strategic objectives (Bandyopadhyay, 2012b). As
such, the focus of organisations lies in using those technologies to enhance the
efficiency of their business, not security. The introduction of digital technologies
such as Cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), BlockChain, Big Data, and
other emerging technologies has extended the cybersecurity landscape due to
23
unknown vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit (Sommerrock et al., 2018).
Cloud computing is services that facilitate the access by consumers to virtual
resources that are scalable and dynamic through the Internet from data centres
located across the world anytime with any device (Bahrami & Singhal, 2015).
There are three types of Clouds i.e. Public, Private and Hybrid which are
delivered through the following service models i.e. Software as a Service (SaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (Ratten,
2016).
Cybersecurity is a dynamic field that is ever-changing however companies have
not caught up with the rate at which new digital technologies are developing and
as such cyber-attacks are increasing with vigour and sophistication (Huang et al.,
2018). Network security continues to be a challenge for managers and executives
due to manifestations of malware that compromise unprotected assets and thus
results in security incidents (Yang & Lui, 2014.; Zou et al., 2016). Aloul (2012, p.
2) state that there are seven causes of increased security incidents world-over,
namely:
a) increase in electronic data,
b) increase in mobile devices,
c) increase of organised cybercrime groups,
d) increase of intelligent external and internal IT security threats,
e) the difficulty of tracing the attackers,
f) limited cybercrime laws, and
g) limited IT security knowledge among internet users
2.4.1 Increase in electronic data
According to a study conducted by IDC (2018), the Global Datasphere will grow
to 175 Zettabytes by 2025, wherein 49 per cent of data will be stored in public
cloud environments. The Global Datasphere quantifies and analyses the amount
of data created, captured, and replicated in any given year across the world.
Additionally, it looks at how much of that data is stored across various storage
components (HDD, flash, optical, tape, and memory).

Figure 3 below illustrates the upward trend that suggests that the world will
experience exponential growth in terms of the size of the global Datasphere.
Figure 3: Anticipated Projection of global Datasphere Source: (IDC, 2018)
Figure 3 above suggests that as the data grows exponentially, cybersecurity
controls must follow a similar path to secure organisational assets. The IDC
(2018) report suggests that the increase in data transactions requires
organisations to continuously learn and make improvements based on the data.
The factors behind data increase include autonomous cars, humanoid robots,
intelligent personal assistants and smart home devices that are shifting how we
work, live and play (IDC, 2018). This signals that data will continue to increase
and will require modern and effective security mechanisms to secure data stored
in cloud storage or internal servers at rest as well as in motion.
2.4.2 Increase in mobile devices
According to Lee, Cheng & Cheng (2007), the increase in mobile devices has
resulted in the creation of economic value. It is estimated that mobile commerce
accounts for US6.9 trillion e-commerce by 2004 and that’s a sizeable amount by
any account (Lee et al., 2007). This increase is attractive for hackers to target
mobile devices for malicious intents (Sujithra et al., 2015).
Figure 4 below illustrates the global Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, wired and
wireless. The wireless traffic includes both Wi-fi and mobile traffic highlighting
exponential growth on both.
25
Figure 4: Global IP traffic, wired and wireless Source: CISCO Visual Networking
Index (2018)
Figure 4 above illustrate the Global IP traffic from the study conducted by CISCO,
a global network firm. By 2020 it is predicted that wired networks will constitute
29 per cent of IP traffic, and Wi-Fi, as well as mobile networks, will account for 71
per cent of IP traffic (‘Cisco Visual Networking Index’, 2018). This view correlates
with the increase in mobile devices and as such, mobile devices are likely to
become targets for cybersecurity attacks (Pescatore, 2017).
The increase in broadband penetration in South Africa promises to stimulate
economic activity and at the same time could expose the citizens to cyber-attacks
(Mooketsi, 2015). Malicious actors could use the country’s cyberspace as a
launching pad for cyber-attacks to the rest of the world (Jardine, 2015). As
technology keeps advancing, so are cyber threats that could impact South African
organisations negatively resulting in financial losses and damage to reputation
(Van Niekerk, 2017).
Figure 5 below illustrates the number of Internet users for selected countries. The
countries listed in figure 5 below relate to the developing world, particularly the
developing nations. Africa is an attractive destination for cyber-attacks as more
and more users have access to the internet (Kshetri, 2019). Globler & Dlamini
(2012, p. 1) state that factors making Africa vulnerable include increasing
bandwidth, increasing use of wireless technologies and infrastructure, high levels
of computer illiteracy, ineffective or insufficient legislation to deal with cyberattacks and threats, as well as increasing Internet penetration rates.
26
Figure 5: Internet users in selected countries in Africa Source: Statista (2019)
According to March 2019 data from Statista (2019), South Africa is ranked
number four in terms of the number of Internet users with 31.19 million. Nigeria
has 111.63 million, followed by Egypt at 49.23 million and Kenya with 43.33.
Majority of the Internet traffic was generated with mobile phones. This can be
attributed to the fact that mobile connections are much cheaper compared to the
infrastructure associated with traditional PC such as fixed-line internet
connection.
The increase in broadband penetration has the potential to leave the country’s
Internet infrastructure vulnerable (Manda & Backhouse, 2017). Thus, a
coordinated effort from all stakeholders such as national government, business,
academia, etc. to develop and implement a robust cybersecurity policy framework
is necessary.
2.4.3 Increase in organised cybercrime groups
According to Raghavan & Parthiban (2014, p. 2) cybercrime is a growing threat
in the virtual world as the use of the internet and other digital technologies growth 
27
thereby heightening the risk of attack by cybercriminals across the globe.
Cybercrime, in the most trivial form, is a crime that occurs in a computer and a
network (Sharma et al., 2016, p. 1). Cybercrime involves using computers and
the Internet by individuals to commit crimes (Hassan et al., 2012, p. 1).
Cybercrime activities involve the use of communication devices such as
computers, telephones, cellular and other technological devices for illicit ends
such as theft, fraud, violating property rights, electronic vandalism and
unauthorised access to computer systems and networks (Kshetri, 2015a).
According to Hassan et al. (2012, p. 1) cyber terrorism, identity theft, and spam
are identified as types of cybercrimes.
Cybercrime’s increase has been driven by the amplification and opportunities
provided by Internet penetration mostly in developing economies (Broadhurst et
al., 2014). Broadhurst et al. (2014) state that such an increase, as well as
advancement in digital technologies, can attract a range of various criminal actors
as hacking tools has become accessible to the general public (Kumari &
Mohapatra, 2016). Cybercriminals are much more organised these days as they
share knowledge and resources such as stolen confidential data, extracts of code
or hacking tools in exchange for financial gain or other virtual goods (Lavorgna &
Sergi, 2016). Due to the lucrative nature of cybercrime, some hackers use
communities such as online platforms to organize into groups and launch
sophisticated, financially-motivated cyber-attacks (Benjamin & Hsinchun Chen,
2012, p. 1).
According to Aloul (2012), most governments in the world are introducing laws to
combat computer crime, also known as e-crime or cybercrime. The impact of
cybercrime is a concern in the modern business environment for most executives.
In 2009, the global cybercrime topped $1 trillion (Anderson et al., 2013). That
figure has significantly increased over the years to a couple of trillions. It was
predicted that the cost of cybercrime is likely to rise from $3 trillion in 2015 to $6
trillion in 2021 with one-third of companies being affected by cybercrime (32%)
(Huang et al., 2018). Von Solms & van Niekerk (2013) conclude that the victims
of cybercrime are not just companies whose intellectual property is compromised 
28
but extend to broad stakeholders within the value system such as customers,
partners, and service providers.
2.4.4 Increase of intelligent external and internal IT security threats
Chou (2013, p. 5) states that security threats can occur from both outsides of and
within organizations. According to the 2019 SolarWinds cybersecurity survey
conducted on 200 US federal government, IT decision-makers and influencers,
56% of security threats emanated from careless/untrained insiders (SolarWinds
Federal Cybersecurity Survey Report, 2019). Figure 6 below illustrates the
sources of security threats emanating from the SolarWinds report.
Figure 6: Federal cybersecurity survey report. Source: SolarWinds (2019)
About 43% cited lack of employee training/awareness, 41% indicated the
increase in the number of devices with access to data and 40% volume of network
activity were noted most often as reasons for difficulties with careless or malicious
insider threats. The report puts forward that 35% of respondents indicated a lack
of IT/security staff to be a challenge that requires urgent attention. About 31% of
respondents highlighted the increase in the use of cloud apps and 24% cited 
29
infrastructure as one of the top reasons for malicious threats that are large
because of contractors having access to systems.
Cloud computing provides necessary flexibility and efficiencies from storage,
processing and cost perspectives, however, sensitive data residing on clouds
may be exposed to cyber theft if not adequately secured (Chou, 2013). IDC
(2018) report highlight the threats such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service
(DDoS), ransomware, botnet, spam, spoofing, phishing, Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs), viruses, worms, hacktivism, spyware, malware and statesponsored cyber warfare to be increasing cyber risk for users and companies.
According to the 2019 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR),
conducted on close to 42000 security incidents and over 2000 data breaches
provided by over 70 data sources, both public and private entities, across 86
countries worldwide (DBIR, 2019). About 69% perpetrated by outsiders with 39%
of breaches are due to organised crime groups and 23% to nation-states or stateaffiliated actors. About 52% of breaches featured hacking, 33% included social
attacks and 28% malware attacks. About 43% of breaches involved small
business victims, 16% public entities, 15% healthcare, and 10% financial
industry. The financial gain represented the biggest driver of data breaches with
71%, followed by 25% breaches motivated by espionage.
2.4.5 The difficulty of tracing the attackers
The escalating rate of cyber incidents and the associated cyber risks impact
negatively on the company brand, reputation, and financial stability of the
organisation (ISACA, 2016). In spite of the advancement in cybersecurity
protective technology, organisations are unable to keep up with the rate of
emerging cyber risks (Yang & Lui, 2014). The prevalence of cyberattack tools
makes it easier for an attacker to launch an attack with a limited chance of being
caught (Sawyer & Hancock, 2018). Cyber-attack can be remotely conducted and
automated to multiple victims due to sophisticated attacks thus tracing the true
source can be time resource-intensive in terms of time and effort (Kumar &
Carley, 2016). This is heightened by the use of Darknet by attackers to hide to
their true source (Choi et al., 2013) and the weakness of cyber defence by most 
30
organisations (Goel & Mehtre, 2015). Darknet typically comprises of a network of
computers with the anonymised identity of individuals and devices that spans
multiple geographies (Arizona State University et al., 2019).
“Cybercrime exploits cross-national differences in the capacity to prevent, detect,
investigate, and prosecute such crime, and is fast becoming a growing global
concern” (United Nations, 2004; Broadhurst et al., 2014, p. 3). In order to track
and trace the source of the attack, a different approach is required and includes
cooperation and partnership amongst nation-states (Bossong & Wagner, 2018).
Intervention could include coordinated breach reporting, effective prosecution,
and long jail terms. An Internet-based collaborative environment to protect critical
infrastructure such as financial institutions, telco providers, etc. from coordinated
cyber-attacks for organisations operating in geographically dispersed locations is
another alternative (Hung, 2016).
The cyberspace anonymity poses a challenge and makes geography inapt as
cybercrime does not occur within the territory of a single country thus an attack
could be launched anywhere and the victims could be in any other part of the
world (Brenner, 2006; Nawang, 2017). This view is consistent with Lipson (2002,
p. 18) who posit that “the anonymity enjoyed by today’s cyber attackers poses a
grave threat to the global information society, the progress of an informationbased international economy, and the advancement of global collaboration and
cooperation in all areas of human endeavour.” Due to the Internet’s limitations, it
is time-consuming to build anomaly detection models to detect unknown attacks
due to low detection accuracy (Choi et al., 2013).
2.4.6 Limited cybercrime laws
According to Arfi & Agarwal (2013, p. 1), cybercrime is a kind of crime that
happens in "cyberspace", between computers and the Internet. Most people have
little or no knowledge of cybercrime due to lack of awareness as well as sufficient
regulatory framework (E Kritzinger & Solms, 2013) and its potential severe impact
on society at large (Arfi & Agarwal, 2013) which includes the direct cost of
victimisation, emotional harm, and associated costs (Hutchings, 2014).
Cybercrime actors are not easily identifiable due to false identities they use online
31
(Goldman & McCoy, 2016). There is no link between the real person and the
perpetrator, as a result, poses a challenge to identify, arrest, and prosecute cyber
criminals that are mostly outside of the law enforcement jurisdiction (Bayoumy,
2018).
According to Armstrong & Forde (2003, p. 1) “money laundering, drug dealing,
terrorism, hacking, fraud, child pornography and the distribution of objectionable
material are crimes that are perpetrated using the Internet.” This view is
supported by Arfi & Agarwal (2013, pp. 1–2) who state cybercrimes are
“committed through the use of computer and Internet remotely and include child
pornography, cyber laundering, cyberstalking, cyber terrorism, cyber theft, and
spam.” These crimes can be categorised into two parts i.e. local cybercrime and
transnational cybercrime (Dupont, 2018). Local cybercrime physically occurs in
the same sovereign territory and transnational cybercrime occurs in different
territories for both the perpetrator and the victim.
South Africa has enacted statutes such the Electronic Communications and
Transactions Act (ECT), Minimum Information Security Standard, the Regulation
of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related
information Act, Protection of Personal Information Act, Cybercrimes and
Cybersecurity Bill, etc. to regulate and counter effect of the cyberattacks
(ww.justice.gov.za, 2019). South Africa has the responsibility to promote
cybersecurity awareness as the State can be held liable for cybercrimes
emanating inside the country (Grobler et al., 2012). This is due to the international
treaties that the country has signed which oblige the country to fulfil its
commitments hence the national cybersecurity policy framework.
2.4.7 Limited IT security knowledge among internet users
Lack of cybersecurity awareness is a concern for organisations in all sectors as
security is multi-faceted and requires diverse expertise to effectively manage the
risk (Hanus & Wu, 2016). This is probably the biggest challenge faced by
organisations. As such, a security policy can only be effective if an organisation
engages its staff on security awareness that is understandable and employees
accept necessary precautions. According to Shaw, Chen, Harris, & Huang
32
(2009), security awareness is about users understanding and appreciating the
importance of cybersecurity as well as their individual and collective
responsibilities in line with approved policies to protect company assets (Collins,
2017). Increasing concerns include but not limited to sharing of corporate
computing resources with non-employees, using corporate computing resources
for non-work related tasks, downloading and installing unsupported and pirated
software, opening unsolicited email and attachments.
Inadequate understanding of security can expose the organisation to security
threats and vulnerabilities that can lead to security incidents (Muller, 2015). In
order to protect organisational assets and profits, organisations must intensify
efforts for improved information security by instituting cybersecurity awareness
programs to ensure that employees are informed of cybersecurity risks (Gcaza &
Solms, 2017). This could be an effective mechanism to lessen the rising threat of
cybersecurity breaches and attacks on company infrastructure. In order to ensure
holistic awareness and understanding of security threats facing information
assets of the organisation is achieved, security awareness must be extended to
individuals tasked with managing information security (Tianfield, 2016). Susanto
& Almunawar (2012, p. 4) state that “security awareness means stakeholders
comprehend that there is the potential to deliberately or accidentally steal,
damage, or misuse the data that is stored in a company's computer system.”
Thus, protecting the company’s assets (information, physical and personal) from
any possible security breach is significant for the continuing sustainability of the
organisation.
Education and training must inform employees’ actions in terms of do’s and don’ts
as well as initiate activities to protect against policy violations and must become
a formal daily task of employees in an organisation (Crumpler & Lewis, 2019).
This must be done in a coordinated and on-going fashion in order to inculcate the
right culture within an organisation (Sutherland, 2017). As drivers of change
management and culture, top management play a significant role in ensuring
organisational security level through planning and reasonable resource allocation
(Larson, 2015). 
33
2.4.8 Proposition 1
The awareness of effective cybersecurity technology controls complement cyber
insurance to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks in the South African industry.
2.5 Cyber risk management
Gordon, Loeb, & Sohail (2003, p. 1) state that the use of “the Internet has
significantly increased the vulnerability of organisations to information theft,
vandalism, and denial-of-service attacks, thereby bringing information security
issues to the forefront of the agenda for corporate executives.” This suggests that
cyber risk is quite high on the agenda for executives as risk management is
interlinked with the long-term sustainability of the company. Bouveret (2018, p.
12) defines risk “as a combination of consequences and likelihood where the
likelihood is a function of threat levels and the ease of exploitation of existing
vulnerabilities”:
Risk = f (Threat, Vulnerability, Consequences)
According to Gordon et al. (2003, p. 3) cyber risk is “the process of assessing
risk, taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level, and maintaining that level
of risk”. Cyber risks are defined as “operational risks to information and
technology assets that have consequences affecting the confidentiality,
availability, or integrity of information or information systems“ (Eling & Wirfs,
2015). Therefore, cyber risk is a major concern among public and private
corporations due to its systemic nature and must be managed as such (Bouveret,
2018).
According to Toregas & Zahn (2014), cybersecurity is a business problem and
requires that senior IT executives translate the risks of cyber-attacks into
numbers that contribute to providing objective information as opposed to common
“fear, uncertainty and doubt” tactic that IT security personnel employs. Bohme &
Schwartz (2010) state that cyber risk must be managed through the usual
approach to business risks i.e. eliminate, mitigate, absorb and transfer. 
34
Business risk landscape has increased significantly with the use of the Internet
as more and more services are accessible online.
As depicted in Figure 7 below, the cyber-risk management framework requires a
risk assessment to take place to determine the high-value vulnerabilities that
should receive security resources.
To optimally assess the risk and determine cost-benefit for security investment
Gordon, Loeb & Sohail (2003) suggest that a value-vulnerability grid should be
used. Figure 7 below illustrates a value-vulnerability grid.
Vulnerability
Value
High Medium Low
High 1 2 3
Medium 4 5 6
Low 7 8 9
Figure 7: Value-vulnerability grid Source: Adapted from (Gordon et al., 2003)
In order to effectively leverage scarce information security resources,
“information falling into boxes 1, 2, 4 and 5 should generally receive the largest
share of the information security budget” (Gordon et al., 2003, p. 4). The priority
boxes mentioned above indicate medium and high ratings for both the value and
vulnerability hence focused security investments.
Kopp et al. (2017, p.2) posit that “firms must actively manage cyber risk and invest
in cybersecurity, and to some extent transfer and pool their risks through cyber
liability insurance policies.” As such, Toregas & Zahn (2014, p.5) proposes a
return on security investment (ROSI) to measure which takes into account that
“security is not usually an investment that provides profit but loss prevention”.
Gordon et al. (2003) argue that the higher levels of security protection will require
lower levels of cyber-risk insurance (and vice versa). Hence cyber insurance, the
transfer of financial risk associated with network and computer incidents to a third
party (Bohme & Schwartz, 2010; Franke, 2017). Figure 8 below illustrates the
cyber insurance decision plan:
35
Figure 8: Cyber insurance decision plan Source: Adapted from (Gordon et al.,
2003)
According to Gordon et al. (2003), a logical cyber insurance decision plan needs
implementation and managerial support. The associated steps include
conducting an information security risk audit, assessing current coverage,
examining available policies, and selecting a policy.
2.5.1 Cyber insurance as a mechanism to manage cyber risk
Cyber insurance risk policies provide cover for losses that occur as a result of
information security beaches (Gordon et al., 2003). Cyber risk possesses unique
qualities, including interdependent security and correlated failure. (Vicevich,
2018). Losses due to cyber risk are frequently small and independent but they
could also have a low frequency and a high impact (‘blackout scenario’)
(Bouveret, 2018). A cyber-attack can result in data loss, reputation loss, and
hinder a business from performing its operational activities thus impact the
financial performance of the organisation (Joshi, Joshi, & Mittal,2019). Therefore,
hacking plays a significant role in cyberattacks on organisations.
While security protection measures may limit cyber-attacks, an alternative way to
manage risk is to transfer the risk to the cyber insurance service provider in the
exchange of paying a premium (Yang & Lui, 2014). Therefore, cyber insurance
can be an effective instrument to transfer cyber risk and complement the benefits
from technological controls that safeguard the information and network assets in
organisations (Bandyopadhyay, 2012b, p. 1).
Cyber insurance can improve cybersecurity through the adoption of best
practices that could be required as a caveat prior to insurance coverage (Kesan
et al., 2005; Kesan & Hayes, 2017). It assists in ensuring that companies
appreciate decent security controls and the cost of lack of good security thereby

resulting in larger investment and enhancements in cybersecurity. To achieve the
above-stated objective, cyber insurance can add value in pre and post-breach
perspectives.
a. Pre-breach
It is suggested that policies must offer premium reductions or discounts for taking
actions that reduce the probability of a loss as a result of the cyber risk (Gordon
et al., 2003). Cyber insurance can be used as an incentive to improve information
security posture within an organisation (Khalili et al., 2018). This will serve as an
incentive for organisations to take coverage for cyber risks. Various models are
suggested, such as partnerships between Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM) and insurance companies to provide benefit to client organisations
(Sommerrock et al., 2018).
Insurers can work with companies to design bespoke cyber insurance products
thereby increasing awareness, improving the information security posture,
assess clients’ contingency plans, train personnel, or recommend best practices
to reduce the effect and fix the breach. This proactive approach will result in a
reduced security incident when it occurs.
b. Post-breach
A growing trend of the partnership between cyber insurance and third-party
service providers (such as OEM, specialists and security experts) is taking shape
in the industry to collaborate for loss prevention and post-breach services
(Camillo, 2017). According to Herr (2019, p. 1), AIG partners with cybersecurity
service providers such as CrowdStrike and Darktrace to make risk assessments
of their clients (Business Wire Staff 2017).
In figure 9 below (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009, p. 3) provides a high-level in the
cyber insurance claims process. Post-breach, insurers offer a number of services
to insureds (customers), such as crisis management, IT forensic, security advice
and legal consultation.
37
Figure 9: Proposed cyber insurance claims process Source: (Bandyopadhyay et
al., 2009)
Figure 9 above illustrate an eight-step process to be followed when processing a
cyber insurance claim (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009). According to Sommerrock
et al. (2018), insurance policies provide services that evaluate the impact,
investigate the attack, and incident response and recovery plans, provide
forensics, public relations and communications support, notify customers, and
identify appropriate mitigating actions to strengthen resilience in the future
(Woods & Simpson, 2017).
First, when the cyber incident occurs, the CIO is notified of the by the CISO.
Thereafter the matters are disclosed to legal to obtain an opinion and public
relation to managing communication to external stakeholders. The events are
then reported on the corporate risk management’s risk register and report the
loss to the finance unit. Woods & Simpson (2017) adds that insurer partner with
cybersecurity experts to limit the impact after the cyber-attack and strive to
institute the cause and extent of the loss prior to underwriting the policyholder.
The claim is filed to an insurer who then appoints an IT assessor/adjuster who
then adjusts/audits the claim and notifies the CIO, CISO and the corporate risk
management unit. As part of cyber insurance contracts, coverage for losses from
other information and network assets could be included as well as the cost of 
38
victim notification, liability compensation and cyber extortion (Bandyopadhyay,
2012b). The assessor notifies the insurer who then decides on whether to
pay/close the claim.
2.5.2 Cyber risk in South Africa
According to statistics from the South African Banking Risk Information Centre
(SABRIC), in 2017 there were 13,438 incidents across banking apps, online
banking, and mobile banking which cost the industry more than R 250 000 000 in
gross losses (‘Digital Banking Crime Statistics’, 2019). Incidents from January to
August 2018, demonstrate a 64% increase in gross loss. However, when
comparing January to August 2017 to the same period in 2018, mobile banking
incidents showed an increase of more than 100%, with gross losses of R23 593
631, while online banking incidents showed an increase of 44% with gross losses
of R89 368 722.
For the same period, banking app incidents increased by 20%, with gross losses
of R70 156 364. SIM swops saw 4040 incidents from January to August 2017,
and 8254 incidents from January to August 2018, an increase of 104%. Modus
operandi includes social engineering, phishing, vishing or the installation of
malware onto a victim’s device by having them click on a link, enabling the
criminal to steal sufficient personal information to access their online banking
profile. According to SABRIC, there is an upward trend in the following frauds:
a) Phishing, Vishing & SMishing
b) SIM Swops
c) Change of Bank Details Scam
d) Email Hacking
According to the IBM (2017) cost of data breach study conducted to 419
companies in 11 countries and two regions, South Africa’s loss is estimated at
$128 million for FY2017 which is higher than the four year average of $115
million. The study predicted that organisations in South Africa, India and Brazil
are most likely to experience a material data breach involving 10,000 or more
records over the next 24 months with South Africa having the highest probability 
39
of experiencing a data breach. As such companies such as Liberty, ViewFines,
City of Johannesburg, etc. have experienced a data breach in the aforementioned
period (Moyo, 2018). According to the report from (Fin24.com, 2018), there were
five data breaches affecting South Africans i.e.
a) Liberty email hack
b) ViewFines licence details
c) Facebook scandal
d) Master Deed’s data breach “biggest” digital security threat in SA
e) Ster-Kinekor’s database compromised
2.5.3 Proposition 2
An organisational approach to cybersecurity determines cyber-risk management
support.
2.6 Cyber insurance market
Cyber insurance is defined as “the transfer of financial risk associated with
network and computer incidents to a third party,” the insurance company, in
exchange for a premium (Toregas & Zahn, 2014, p.6). Toregas & Zahn (2014)
posit that the market for cyber insurance policies is at its infancy and expected to
grow in the future. According to (Bandyopadhyay, 2012b, p. 1), cyber insurance
refers to the specific insurance contracts that provide coverage against loss from
theft of data and IS assets.
To complement security protective technology, the residual risk that remains is
transferable to a cyber insurance provider. As such, the cyber insurance market
will mature as more corporates begin to see the value it adds to the business.
Hurtaud, Flamand, Hounka (2015) state that there has been a steady increase in
the size of the cyber insurance market as the U.S. constitutes about 90% of global
cyber insurance market with early adopters being financial services companies,
retailers and healthcare organisations with large amounts of personally
identifiable information (PII). 
40
In comparison to the EU, the growth is due to the mandatory data breach
notification laws in the US. Hurtaud et al. (2015) point out that with the adoption
of the GDPR, the EU is likely to catch up with US counterparts as there are
requirements to speedily notify authorities when breaches to personal data occur.
The cyber insurance market is projected to be a multi-billion dollar industry which
is accelerated by the growing cyber-attacks on companies (Herr, 2019). This view
is affirmed by further observations that suggest that the market is likely to reach
$20 billion or more by 2025 (Camillo, 2017) and over 70 cyber insurance carriers
around the world (Khalili et al., 2018). Cyber insurance enables companies to
manage cyber risks by transferring part of their risks to insurers in exchange for
paying a premium (Kesan et al., 2004; Kesan & Hayes, 2017).
Bohme & Kataria (2006) agrees with the above prediction and augments that
American International Group (AIG) and Lloyd’s of London are the leading
providers of cyber-insurance in the market. Additionally, other prominent market
players include Chubb’s Cyber Security, AIG’s NetAdvantage Security, Hiscox’s
Hackers Insurance, Legion Indemnity’s INSUREtrust, Lloyd’s e-Comprehensive,
Marsh’s NetSecure, and St. Paul’s Cybertech (Gordon et al., 2003).
Camillo (2017) contends that the cyber insurance market today has matured
substantially and has become specialised and innovative in terms of product and
service offerings. This includes products that cater to small- to medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), the mid-market sector as well as very large multinational
corporations. The insurance industry recognizes cybersecurity as an issue at the
national and international levels (Vicevich, 2018). As such, companies of all sizes
are beginning to appreciate the benefits of cyber insurance as a risk transfer
mechanism.
The literature review notes that not all views are uniform and optimistic,
particularly earlier studies have divergent views compared to recent studies.
Points of divergence on the growth and size of the cyber insurance market are
prevalent. For instance, Toregas & Zahn (2014) state that the growth of the cyber
insurance market has somewhat been tentative and slow in developed
economies such as the US. Gordon et al. (2003) supplement that cyber-risk 
41
insurance is a new product with underwriters being hesitant to offer large policies
(relative to traditional insurance).
However, Lloyds offers limits for its e-Comprehensive policy of $50,000,000 and
gives custom quotes up to $200,000,000. This observation is consistent with
Bandyopadhyay et al. (2009) who posit that cyber insurance products remain
underutilized after more than a decade later of commercialisation. This suggests
that the forecasting of the evolution of the cyber insurance market needs
adjustment.
Since cyber insurance product and service offerings are fairly new in the industry,
particularly in the context of South Africa, availability of data on cyber risk and
therefore cyber insurance is scarce (Bouveret, 2018). This could be attributed to
the fact that institutions that have been compromised do not disclose incidences
(Symantec, 2016; Eling & Schnell, 2016). This view is echoed by Bouveret (2018)
who states that data on cyber incidents is scarce and therefore limited
quantitative analyses of cyber risk.
Lack of common standards to record them is cited as the primary factor, and firms
have no incentives to report them (Bouveret, 2018). In the South African context,
legislation such as the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) could change
that narrative, as firms will be required to report each incident to the regulator
(POPIA, 2013). Therefore, residual cybersecurity risks are mitigated using cyber
insurance (Bandyopadhyay & Mookerjee, 2017).
Based on the views expressed above, for and against the cyber insurance market
size and its potential growth, in South Africa the industry is likely to grow due to
the introduction of legislation such as POPI, growing data breaches and cyberattacks as highlighted above. Indeed, the cyber insurance market is still in its
early stages. However, as Eling & Schnell (2016, p.9) point out that as market
development continues, the risk pools will become larger and more data will be
available. Accordingly, future prospects look set to increase upward as the
industry matures (Woods & Simpson, 2017).

2.6.1 Types of cyber insurance liability covers
According to (Hurtaud, Flamand, & Hounka, 2015, p. 3), cyber insurance can
complement an organisation’s active security measures by providing insurance
coverage in three broad areas:
a) Liability for a data breach or loss
b) Remediation costs (e.g. for investigating the breach, notifying
affected parties, etc.)
c) Regulatory fines/penalties and settlement costs
Camillo (2017) augments that prominent in most cyber insurance policy covers
include cyber exposures, which are not included in “traditional” insurance policies
(Toregas & Zahn, 2014). Bouveret (2018) states that cyber risk can impact first
(the target) and third parties (a counterpart to the target).
According to Gordon et al. (2003, p. 4), the first-party risk takes place when the
insured is faced with the possibility of a loss of profits as a result of the theft of
trade secrets, destruction of the property (including hardware, software, and
data), and extortion from hackers. Whereas the third party is due to direct or
indirect damage to organisations infrastructure, reputation or revenue because of
an attack on systems and data. Table 1 below provides a comparison of different
cyber insurance providers, product offering as well as types of policy coverage.
Table 1: Comparison of cyber insurance policies (Marotta, Martinelli,
Yautsiukhin, & Nanni, 2015)
43
As can been seen in table 1 above, not all insurance carriers cover the same
exposures. Largely, there is a trade-off in terms of the covered risk. Such
exposures include loss or damage to digital assets, data recovery, business
interruption, notification costs, liability in respect of data breaches, multimedia
liability, employee dishonesty, cyber extortion and regulatory defence costs
(Camillo, 2017, p. 4). Figure 10 below illustrates the most covered losses due to
cyber-attacks.
Figure 10: Most covered losses Source: (Romanosky et al., 2019)
As shown in figure 10 above, the top five most covered losses are the cost of
claims expenses, penalties; public relations services; notification to affected
individuals; service to affected individuals and business income loss (Romanosky
et al., 2019). With the exception of business income loss, the top four covered
losses relate to external stakeholders.
According to Romanosky et al. (2019) cost of claims, expenses related to
penalties, defence and settlement costs whereas public relations services include
advertising or special promotions as well as media briefing. It is unsustainable to
cover all possible risks; figure 11 below illustrates the cyber insurance exclusions.
44
Figure 11: Policy exclusions Source: (Romanosky et al., 2019)
According to Romanosky et al. (2019, p. 15), most exclusions relate to criminal,
fraudulent, or dishonest acts, errors or omissions, intentional violation of a law,
any ongoing criminal investigation or proceedings, and payment of fines,
penalties, or fees. Additionally, some policies provide further exclusions for
infringement of patents, disclosures of trade secrets or confidential information,
or violations of securities laws.
The cyber insurance market faces various challenges, with the setting of
premiums being one of the biggest issues (Toregas & Zahn, 2014). This view is
exacerbated by the belief, as Toregas & Zahn (2014) point out, that risks
associated with cyber-attacks are not quantifiable and thus, not insurable.
Vicevich (2018) concludes that the insurance industry is unable to pool risk.
Figure 12 below illustrates the cyber insurance premiums.
45
Figure 12: Cyber insurance premium Source: (Herr, 2019)
As shown in figure 12 above, there has been an exponential growth in the cyber
insurance premium. Between 2012 and 2014 there was an exponential growth of
300% wherein the total premiums from coverage jumped from US$835 million to
US$2 billion in 2014 and an estimated US$4 billion in 2017 (Knockless 2015;
Herr, 2019). It is suggested that exponential growth was due to demand from
small and medium companies. Over 90% of insurers noted growth in demand
between 2012 and 2014, mainly from the retail sector (Advisen Ltd. 2014, pp. 4–
5; (Herr, 2019, p. 9).
2.6.2 Drivers of cyber insurance
A growing appreciation of cyber vulnerabilities did not immediately translate into
demand for insurance (Camillo, 2017). Despite the awareness of the cyber risks
and risk damage they can cause to the organisation, investment in security, as
well as availability of cyber insurance, is still scarce thus the rampant cyberattacks (Yang & Lui, 2014). Cyber insurance is the outsourcing of low frequency,
high impact risk (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013). An opportunity exists for
institutions, insurers, legislators, and regulators to create an environment
conducive for information sharing for reporting. Firms that are prone to cyberattacks are more likely to take the cyber insurance (Gordon et al., 2003).
46
Organisations can adopt cyber insurance as a management tool for reducing the
risk of financial losses associated with Internet-related breaches.
Cyber insurance plays an important role in improving the cybersecurity control
environment and it mutually beneficial for both the insurers and insureds (Woods
& Simpson, 2017). Policy-makers and well as insurance providers have a role to
play in the sustainability of the cyber insurance industry. Woods & Simpson
(2017, p. 3) posit that a fragmented policy landscape could provide an additional
barrier to the growth of the market. Therefore, public-private partnership is
essential to ensure that there is a consideration of the interests of all stakeholders
in development cybersecurity insurance market and policy measures. Cyber
insurance investment translates to improved security due to the adoption of more
secure practices within an organisation thereby reducing cyber risks (Kesan &
Hayes, 2017).
Organisations are beginning to appreciate the value that the cyber insurance
provides i.e. financial cover in the event losses occur due to a security incident
(Joshi, Joshi, & Mittal, 2019). This assists an organisation to safeguard against
the threat posed by the malicious actors. Joshi et al. (2019) do, however, point
out that in order for the cyber insurance to increase adoption by companies,
disagreements on coverages and exclusions rules needs to be addressed
between insurance providers and insured customer. It can be deduced that
interpretation of policy provisions by insured companies and gaps due to lack of
cybersecurity by insurance service providers create challenges during a claim.
To address this deficit, Joshi et al. (2019), proposes an automated approach that
utilises machine learning and artificial intelligence to determine current security
controls thereby arriving at an informed policy coverage. This will ensure that all
stakeholders have the same understanding of what the cyber insurance policy
cover entails. According to Hurtaud, Flamand, Hounka (2015, p. 3) cyber
insurance adoption among organisations remains at a low level in spite of the
increase in cyber incidents. In the US, it is estimated that 65% of publicly-traded
companies do not have cyber insurance (Hurtaud et al., 2015). This is an
incongruity as 63% of decision-makers indicate that cyber risk is one of their
biggest challenges. According to Hurtaud et al. (2015), it is due to the lack of 
47
cyber insurance awareness, underwriting complexity, and the challenge of
aligning insurance with risk exposure.
2.6.3 Challenges of cyber insurance
Cyber insurance serves as an additional layer to cyber resilience however the
lack of cogent and systemic approach to risk management could pose a
challenge for an organisation if left unattended (Huang et al., 2018). Various
scholars have identified different challenges that the cyber insurance market
faces. Bandyopadhyay et al. (2009) cite the following three challenges as the
most common reason for the cyber insurance market slow growth:
a) Insufficient attack-loss data
b) Lack of product-market experience
c) Accounting difficulties
Furthermore, a 2018 study conducted by the MIT Sloan School of Management
and the Boston Consulting Group to 45 interviews with underwriters, brokers,
reinsurers, and customers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia added the following
challenges facing the cyber insurance market (Sommerrock et al., 2018).
a) The unique nature of cyber risk.
b) The difficulty in measuring and understanding accumulation risk.
c) The limited availability and sharing of cyber incidents and claims data.
d) The impact of regulation.
e) The effect of new technologies on cybersecurity.
The underdevelopment for the cyber insurance market is due to underwriters’
lack of experience with cyber risk and scarce actuarial data impeding economical
pricing (Wirfs, 2016). The lack of standardisation reflects the fact that cyber
insurance is a relatively new cover, its evolution out of existing products (e.g. tech
E&O and property insurance) and the competitive nature of the business
(Camillo, 2017). Data on cyber risk are scarce since companies are either
unaware of a cyber-attack (Toregas & Zahn, 2014) or the victims are reluctant to 
48
report such events. Eling & Schnell (2016) argue that most empirical papers on
cyber risk rely on data breach information (not loss information).
Yang & Lui (2014, p. 2) highlight two main challenges associated with cyber
insurance i.e. adverse selection and moral hazard. The challenge with adverse
selection arises when the insurance provider is unable to distinguish between
high and low-risk hosts. Woods & Simpson (2017) adds that adverse selection
occurs where a firm may apply for cyber insurance in the knowledge that they are
relatively more exposed to cyber risk. Figure 13 below illustrates the different
types of protections that the company should explore.
Figure 13: Cyber protection Adapted from (Kesan et al., 2005)
As shown in figure 13, the combination of self-protection and insurance raises the
problem of moral hazard, in which nodes covered by insurance may take fewer
secure measures, or even falsify their loss (Yang & Lui, 2014). Moral hazard
happens when the insurance provider cannot observe the protection level of
nodes (Yang & Lui, 2014) and can be addressed by the ongoing relationship
between the insurer and the policyholder (Woods & Simpson, 2017). Table 2
below summarises cyber insurance challenges based on three categories:

These factors have led to conservatism by providers that err on the safe side by
overpricing their products (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009). If that trend grows, the
cyber insurance market may be unsustainable (Vicevich, 2018).
2.6.4 Proposition 3
Compliance with regulations enables organisations to adopt cyber insurance in
the South African industry to reduce the risk of financial losses associated with
cyber breaches.
2.7 Conclusion of the Literature Review
In this chapter, a review of the literature on cyber insurance was conducted.
Background of cybersecurity was provided to highlight the impact on
organisations. A TOE framework was nominated to underpin this chapter to meet 
50
the research objectives (Tornatzky et al., 1990). A link between cybersecurity and
digital technology was unpacked to illustrate the risks to organisations that come
with emerging technologies.
The effects of cyber risks were explored and cyber insurance was proposed to
complement existing controls to minimize financial loss. A brief exploration of
cyber risks in the context of South Africa was presented and various incidents
highlighted. The global size of the market was presented and types of liability
covers were discussed. Various cybersecurity threats that influence factors cyber
insurance were discussed as well as benefits to organisations.
Cyber insurance is without challenges, as such, drivers of adoption were
highlighted. This study is based on the adapted (Tornatzky et al., 1990)
theoretical framework called Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE)
framework. The theoretical perspectives are used to identify factors influencing
cyber insurance adoption in the public and private sectors in South Africa. Three
propositions that will be tested and validated through a qualitative approach are
listed below:
2.7.1 Proposition 1
The awareness of effective cybersecurity technology controls complement cyber
insurance to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks in the South African industry.
2.7.2 Proposition 2
An organisational approach to cybersecurity determines cyber risk management
support.
2.7.3 Proposition 3
Compliance with regulations enables organisations to adopt cyber insurance in
the South African industry to reduce the risk of financial losses associated with
cyber breaches.

CHAPTER 3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
The literature review, Chapter 2, enabled the study to gain deeper insights into
cybersecurity, cyber risk management, and cyber insurance theories. This
chapter presents the research approach and the high-level design of this study.
The data were collected using structured interviews based on the questions in
Appendix A. The research questions were designed based on the constructs of
the TOE framework and aligned with three propositions. This was done in an
attempt to gain in-depth industry perception on the adoption of cyber insurance
in the public and private sectors in South Africa. Thematic content analysis was
employed to analyse data.
The study will ensure the highest regard to ethical considerations to ensure the
transferability and credibility of the research methodology employed. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to present an understanding of the constructs in
charge of proving or disproving the propositions based on the real-world
perception of the factors influencing the adoption of cyber insurance in public and
private sectors in South Africa.
3.2 Research approach
This study employed a qualitative research approach to explore and understand
the meaning participants assign to the concept of cyber insurance in South Africa
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017). The rationale is due to the study’s relevance to
socio-economic factors influencing the adoption of cyber insurance in the public
and private sectors in South Africa. The research approach used to collect data
was predominantly qualitative for the nominated demographic who are assumed
to have an understanding of the study based on their work experience in the
space. The study employs an inductive approach as it provides methodical
flexibility through observing emerging patterns and themes from the interview
questions (Liu, 2016). 
52
3.3 Research design
The research design is grounded on the propositions that were framed using the
TOE framework as an overall guide and feedback from open-ended semistructured interview questions conducted to 10 participants that were deemed to
possess the necessary skills, experience, and understanding of cyber insurance
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017). The research study design comprises of research
objectives, which lead to the three propositions using the interview questions
which is most suitable for a qualitative study to make an inquiry on the cyber
insurance concept (Flick, 2014).
Underpinned by the TOE framework to identify factors influencing the adoption of
cyber insurance in the public and private sectors in South Africa, the premise on
semi-structured interviews to elucidate socio-economic on the three propositions
made (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). In line with the research objectives and to
develop theory from the ground, the study uses the inductive approach with an
intention to pursue South African industry insights (Thomas, 2003). Figure 14
below illustrates the high-level research design supported by the three
propositions derived from the TOE framework.
Figure 14: Summary of research design
As shown in figure 14 above, the research study has adapted the TOE framework
(Bandyopadhyay, 2012b) which translates to three propositions centred on the
technology, organisation, and environment. The study is conducted by
investigationg individuals that are positioned at strategic, tactical and operational

levels in organisations. These levels are operationalised through organisational

organisational objectives.Structured interview questions are designed using the
elements of the TOE framework and thematic analysis will be used to inductively
analyse the findings from the semi-structured interview questions (Creswell &
Creswell, 2017). Data analysis is based on the thematic content analysis to
extract essences and essentials of participant meanings (Miles et al., 2014).
3.4 Data collection methods
The data collection method employs semi-structured interviews as the method
best suited for the description of the factors influencing the adoption of cyber
insurance in the public and private sectors in South Africa. There are 10 face-toface semi-structured interview questions that are used to probe 10 participants to
gain deeper insight into cyber insurance adoption in the South African industry
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017).
The emphasis was to ask probing questions to gain deeper insight into the cyber
insurance adoption in the South African industry using the TOE framework on IT
professionals (Harrell & Bradley, 2009). The participants are purposefully
selected as they have the necessary understating of the research problem and
questions due to their experience in IT (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Collected
data were used to triangulate in order to nullify or affirm the research study’s
theoretical perception (Langa, 2016).
3.5 Population and sample
3.5.1 Population
The population consists of all IT professionals in the public and private sectors
(including cyber insurance providers) in the South African industry operating at
strategic, tactical and operational organisation levels to enable triangulation
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017). The rationalisation was to probe the level of 
54
understanding, knowledge, and experience in various levels of cyber insurance
concept thus answering semi-structured interview questions (Taherdoost, 2016).
3.5.2 Sample and sampling method
Qualitatively, 10 participants were interviewed comprising Chief Information
Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officers, Executive Manager, Heads of
Department, Information Security Manager, IT Audit Manager, Cyber Risk, and
Risk Consulting, as well as Principal Specialist responsible for cybersecurity,
cyber risk and cyber insurance from selected organisations. The selected sample
was justified based on the primary aim to understand the factors influencing cyber
insurance adoption in South Africa industry. The study focused on companies
operating in the South African public and private sector albeit some organisations
have global operations thus assigning an international perspective to enhance
diverse viewpoints.
The study employed purposive random sampling through the use of the LinkedIn
professional network that is small in the South African cyber insurance industry
adoption context and will be covered in-depth (Miles et al., 2014). Table 3 below
highlights the profile of interview respondents.

TOTAL number of respondents 10
The sample size of 10 participates was reasoned satisfactory as the information
required for the research study was responded with sufficient assertion thus
reaching the saturation point. Saturation occurs where no new discernments from
the added analysis are found (Bowen, 2008) or all angles of the study have been
sufficiently covered (Fusch & Ness, 2015). In terms of this specific study, the
saturation point was grasped at the eighth interview with the remaining two
interviews conducted to confirm the saturation point had been reached.
3.6 The research instrument
The research instrument was based on the qualitative method using the semistructured interviews that were linked to the three propositions stemming from the
TOE theoretical framework (Talmy, 2010). Ten semi-structured interview
questions based on TOE framework constructs are designed in English for ease
of understanding by participants and interpretation. Qualitative research interview
is defined as “an interview, whose purpose is to gather descriptions of the lifeworld of the interviewee with respect to interpretation of the meaning of the
described phenomena” (Opdenakker, 2006, p. 1).
Appendix A illustrates the semi-structured interview questions. The advantage of
semi-structured interview questions is that it is conducted through face-to-face as
well as using the telephone. Face-to-face and telephone semi-structured
interviews have the advantage of being scheduled at the appropriate place and
time as well as spontaneous response with frequent follow-up questions to probe
further (Opdenakker, 2006). Out of 10 interviews, nine were conducted face-toface as participants are located in Gauteng Province and only one was conducted
using telephone due to time and availability constraints albeit being located in
Gauteng Province. The disadvantages of telephone interviews are that the
participant is not visible and there is a possibility of communication interruption.
To alleviate the loss of communication, all interviews were recorded using a
recording device with the permission of participants and transcribed using Otter.ai 
56
web application. Appendix B provides the participant information sheet and
consent form.
3.7 Procedure for data collection
The procedure of research encompasses open-ended semi-structured interview
questions; a collection of data occurred at the participant’s preferred location,
creating data analysis inductively from basic codes to general themes, and
arriving at interpretations of the meaning of the data thus enabling report writing
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017).
The technique used to collect data on the purposive sample was semi-structured
face-to-face and to some extent, telephonic interviews wherein participants were
given an opportunity to express their experiences, understanding, and views on
the cyber insurance phenomenon (Hox & Boeije, 2005). Prior to the
commencement of the interview process, the interviewer explained the purpose
of the interview and requested the interviewees to familiarise themselves with the
Participant Information Sheet to complete and sign the consent form (Appendix
B). Ten semi-structured interview questions were designed and developed based
on the TOE framework (Appendix A). Participants were identified using the
LinkedIn professional network to ensure experience, understanding, and views
on the cyber insurance phenomenon. Contact of participants occurred through
email to arrange for an interview session that occurred between 28 October 2019
to 18 November 2019. Out of ten interviews, nine were face-to-face and only one
was telephonic due to time constraints on the part of the participant.
Whilst notes were taken, all interviews were recorded using a recording device
with permission from the interviewee. The interview started with the researcher
providing an introduction to the research study and proceeded with open-ended
questions that were semi-structured to allow the participant to provide prompt
feedback. Where necessary, follow up questions were asked to probe for further
insight thus enriching the data collection technique. Towards the end of the
interview, all interviewees were thanked for their time and insightful contribution
to the research study. The recorded data was then uploaded on the Otter.ai web 
57
application to transcribe recordings. The output of the transcript was compared
to recordings as well as the notes taken to ensure accuracy and completeness
that became useful for data analysis and interpretation.
3.8 Data analysis and interpretation
The qualitative method chosen follows a systemic approach wherein purposeful
sampling of 10 participants led to the collection of data using open-ended semistructured interview questions that were analysed using thematic analysis
followed by interpretation of findings (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Recording of
10 interviews was uploaded on Otter.ai web application to facilitate transcriptions.
Microsoft Excel was used to extract and present raw data to enable coding.
Coding in qualitative analysis enables breaking down data to develop expansive
categories and themes to reach saturation as well as conducting triangulation
thus eliminating research bias (Yeh & Inman, 2007). Saturation occurs where no
new discernments from the added analysis are found (Bowen, 2008) or all angles
of the study have been sufficiently covered (Fusch & Ness, 2015). In terms of this
specific study, the saturation point was reached at the eighth interview with the
remaining two interviews conducted to confirm the saturation point had been
reached.
Triangulation supports a finding to demonstrate multiple independent sources
that are in agreement or do not contradict so that they can complement each
(Miles et al., 2014). Triangulating multiple instances on various sources from
disparate industries in terms of strategic, tactical and operational viewpoints to
collaborate to enhance the trustworthiness of findings (Miles et al., 2014). This
examination and re-examination of various sources at dissimilar points in time
validated the transparent interpretive and constructive processes of the
researcher (Yeh & Inman, 2007). Whilst thematic was a predominant method of
analysis, quantitising strategy was employed to transform qualitatively collected
data to numbers (Langa, 2016) thereby obtaining deeper meaning from
participants experiences (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Data interpreted through
finding deeper meaning, ideas emerging and insights from the study were
58
subsequently displayed or presented on the report using texts, quotations, tables,
and figures (Yeh & Inman, 2007). The weighing of participant’s words and
researcher interpretations took place thus creating equilibrium ensuring
interpretation of deeper meaning from experiences (Miles et al., 2014).
3.9 Limitations of the study
The research study was limited to the sample of 10 participants that do not
represent the entire South African industry. As such, the views and opinions are
limited in scope. Qualitative studies are deemed to be subjective in nature
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017) therefore the views, experiences, and meanings are
contextual to the 10 participants (Miles et al., 2014) and analysis of data took
longer to complete as it was conducted manually using Microsoft Excel. Some of
the participants were quite senior in their respective careers so scheduling time
in their diary became a challenge, which was overcome by scheduling according
to their availability.
3.10 Transferability and dependability
3.10.1 Transferability
The study employed purposive sampling through the use of the LinkedIn
professional network that is small in the South African cyber insurance industry
adoption context which was covered in-depth (Miles et al., 2014). The sample
comprised 10 participants who purposefully have sufficient understanding and
experience of the South African industry in terms of cyber insurance phenomenon
(Hox & Boeije, 2005). The findings are contextual which can thus be transferred
or applied to another situation or population (Noble & Smith, 2015).
3.10.2 Dependability
The study ensures dependability through unique feedback based on the
personal/human experiences of participants (Noble & Smith, 2015). The findings
are unique for each identified source so that variation in participant experience is 
59
considered (Kuper et al., 2008). As such, each participant's feedback is
considered important to the research study findings as it adds an element of
uniqueness and provides varying insights in a clear and transparent manner
(Noble & Smith, 2015). The use of codes, categories, and themes as well as
triangulating multiple sources to enable effective data to display assisted in
meeting dependability criteria (Yeh & Inman, 2007).
3.10.3 Credibility
The purpose of the study was described to all participants to ensure consistency
and truth value (Connelly, 2016). The research study employed the TOE
framework (Bandyopadhyay, 2012b) to ensure that interview questions were
relevant to the cyber insurance phenomenon to obtain findings (Creswell &
Creswell, 2017). The study employed saturation and triangulation to ensure
credibility wherein researcher bias was eliminated (Yeh & Inman, 2007).
This ensured that collected data reached the point of redundant or saturation at
the eighth interview resulting in no new knowledge added to the study (Yeh &
Inman, 2007). Triangulation was utilised to eliminate researcher subjectivity and
support the attainment of multidimensionality to the data set (Yeh & Inman, 2007).
The study sought to uniquely present findings in the most accurate manner by
describing or interpretation participant experience with the cyber insurance
phenomenon (Kuper et al., 2008).
3.10.4 Confirmability
To ensure confirmability and therefore enhancing findings, the research study
sought to pay attention to participants by probing more clarity seeking questions
in a given context to unearth hiding participant experiences of cyber insurance
phenomenon (Noble & Smith, 2015). As such, this was attained through the
combination of transferability and credibility as well as employing reflexive
strategy as the researcher is a cybersecurity professional (Kuper et al., 2008).

3.11 Demographic profile of the respondent
The study intended to identify and interview 10 participants and as such all
respondents cooperated with the researcher’s request and presented on
Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. The respondents are categorised on the role, the
number of professional years of experience, industry, and description as well as
the perceived level to meet research objectives (Patil et al., 2005). Table 4 below
presents the demographic profile of 10 respondents:
Table 4: Demographic profile of respondents

Koppenhaver, 2004). Information that was collected about respondents pertains
to the role/function as well as the number of professional years of experience to
ensure consistency with the chosen purposive sampling strategy (Miles et al.,
2014). The average number of professional years of experience is 14 which
illustrates the depth of understanding of the cyber insurance concept. Two
participants that had a similar job title of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
namely CISO A and CISO B from the Beverages and ICT sectors respectively of
the South African industry. The industry is categorised as public and private with
five per sector with industry description. Respondents are also categorised as
strategic, tactical and operational levels wherein five respondents were perceived
to strategic and the remaining five being tactical based on their role. None of the
respondents was perceived to be operational which was the limitation of the study
to provide varying perspectives.
3.12 Ethical considerations
Prior to data collection and ethics clearance was issued by the authorising
committee to eliminate harm to respondents (Roberts, 2015). During the data
collection process, consent was obtained from respondents taking into account
the needs of the research project and balancing them with respondents right to
privacy (Houghton et al., 2010). As such respondents identities were anonymised
to maintain confidentiality thereby protecting respondents from any potential
prejudice (Markham, 2012).
Respondents recording and transcriptions were kept secure in a passwordprotected computer to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data collected
through the interview process (Parry & Mauthner, 2004). Data analysis and
interpretation were subjected to scrutiny to minimise researcher bias thereby
ensuring the trustworthiness of data collected (Dowling, 2005). Due care was
exercised to ensure the research project adheres to ethical conduct (Langa,
2016) as such enhancing research credibility.

CHAPTER 4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Introduction
Chapter 3, the Research Methodology, provided a systemic approach and design
of the qualitative research to obtain insights from the purposefully selected
sample using open-ended semi-structured interview questions to collect data
(Hox & Boeije, 2005). As shown in Table 4 above, the sample comprised five
respondents from the public sector and another five from the private sector of the
South African industry. The average years of experience are 14 years thus
providing a sufficient combination of knowledge, skills, and understanding of the
cyber insurance concept. Private sector organisations in Beverages, ICT,
Manufacturing, and Financial services industries have global operations. Based
on the sample, two Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) professionals from
the Beverages and ICT sectors, namely, CISO A and CISO B respectively for
ease of identification. Out of ten participants, nine interviews were through faceto-face and one through telephone due to the non-availability of the respondent.
Recordings of all interviews took place using the recording device and recordings
were uploaded onto Otter.ai web application to transcribe. Microsoft Excel was
utilised to code and classify data into categories leading to emerging themes
(Creswell & Creswell, 2017).
Chapter 4, Findings and Discussion, seeks to present and discuss the findings
obtained through 10 interview questions to provide deeper meaning and
interpretation of perspectives obtained from 10 participants (Creswell & Creswell,
2017). To ensure credibility and transferability of findings to another context,
triangulation and saturation concepts are employed thus enriching the meaning
of participants experiences (Yeh & Inman, 2007). The categories of saturation
include the demand-side, which represents nine organisations that may adopt
cyber insurance and one supply-side organisation that is a cyber insurance
service provider. The study employed inductive thematic analysis of findings as
the most suitable approach to meet research objectives (Langa, 2016) thus
classifying respondents as strategic, tactical and operational management levels
based on their perceived role, understanding and experience (White, 2009).
63
Operations pertain to respondents who provide input to management through
administrative tasks, tactical pertains to interpreting and organising tasks for
decision making and strategic level is about aggregating and analysis for
informed decision making (White, 2009).
Furthermore, analysis and interpretation of findings seek to confirm or deny
propositions emanating from the literature review (Ryan, 2006). Alignment of
research objectives, research propositions, research interview questions and
emerging research themes from findings took place to ensure transparency and
consistency. Table 5 below illustrates the alignment to ensure consistency
throughout the research process.

Table 5 above illustrates the alignment of research objectives, propositions
emanating from the literature review, interview questions and the emerging
themes from collected data through semi-structured interviews. The objective of
this study is to investigate factors influencing cyber insurance adoption in the
South African industry from the perspective of technology, organisation, and
environment. The TOE framework enabled the formulation of three propositions
based on the literature review that culminated in the design of ten interview
questions (Bandyopadhyay, 2012b). The outcome of the data collected from the
purposive sample inductively led to three emerging themes (Miles et al., 2014).
4.2 Discussion pertaining to Proposition 1
Proposition 1 from the literature review proposed that the awareness of effective
cybersecurity technology controls complement the adoption of cyber insurance
to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks in the South Africa industry. The design of
five questions provided answers to the proposition that ultimately led to the theme
below which is linked to the research objective on technology about awareness
and effectiveness.
4.2.1 Effective cybersecurity awareness
Cybersecurity awareness has a direct link to the perception of cybersecurity
technology within an organisation. During the interview process, participants had 
66
to select options designed through literature to gauge their general perception of
cybersecurity. Table 6 below illustrates the perceptions of cybersecurity as
obtained from the purposefully selected sample of 10 professionals in the South
African industry.

Table 6 above illustrates the participants’ responses in terms of their general
cybersecurity perceptions. Quantitising strategy was employed to transform
qualitatively collected data to numbers (Langa, 2016) thereby obtaining deeper
meaning from participants experiences (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Overall, the
responses seemed positive with few respondents noting negative sentiments.
Notably, all respondents seemed to agree that cybersecurity detects, prevents
and corrects external and internal threats to mitigate cyber risks (Carlton & Levy,
2017; Stallings et al., 2012). IT Audit Manager stated “Cybersecurity is important
for the business to operate securely” suggesting organisations must pay attention
to cybersecurity for long-term sustainability.
70% of respondents consider cybersecurity as a mechanism that enhances the
privacy and protection of personal information. The Manager: Information
Security agrees, “Cybersecurity ensure organisations maintain customer‘s
information and is protected at all time i.e. privacy” highlighting the need for 
67
organisations to protect customers information. It is the organisation’s
responsibility to uphold and protect customer’s privacy for information collected,
processed and stored on information systems (Isaak & Hanna, 2018; Mubarak
Alharbi et al., 2013).
60% of respondents considered cybersecurity to secure electronic data activity
on servers, workstations, and mobile devices. The Principal Specialist added,
“Cybersecurity is about securing infrastructure to prevent hackers from accessing
systems or applications”, reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity at the
multinational manufacturing organisation to secure physical operations from
disruptions (Mo et al., 2011). On a separate event, 60% of respondents
suggested that cybersecurity improves end-user knowledge about secure
practices. The CIO supports, “The biggest weakest link in cybersecurity is people”
thus, putting into effect the need for organisations to educate end-users. There is
a close link between effective cybersecurity practices and the level of end-user
understanding of cybersecurity thus making end-users key stakeholders in
protecting organisational assets (Bakhshi, 2017; Stanton et al., 2005).
Finally, only 30% of respondents consider cybersecurity to facilitate the
implementation of cybercrime laws. CISO B seemed to disagree, “whether you
have cybersecurity controls within the organisation or not, it doesn’t influence the
laws, therefore, it is an indirect relationship” highlighting that cybercrime laws
facilitate cybersecurity implementation (Choucri et al., 2014) and not the other
way around.
Overwhelmingly, out of ten respondents nine (90%) demonstrated positive
sentiment towards the importance of awareness of cybersecurity technology and
the benefits to their respective organisations. Only one (10%) respondent
appeared to have a negative view about the state of awareness at their
organisation. Lack of security awareness is a concern for organisations in all
sectors as security is multi-faceted and requires diverse expertise to effectively
manage the risk (Ben-Asher & Gonzalez, 2015). As such, the Divisional Head:
ICT Governance & Compliance stated “In this organisation, cybersecurity is not
taken seriously due to the cost of maintaining the proper cybersecurity
programme, cost of implementation and lack of understanding the value of data,”
68
suggesting that the metropolitan municipality cybersecurity maturity is low. The
Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting echoed this view “that budget
and management buy-in can be an issue in some organisations” thus requiring
an effective strategic approach to obtain management buy-in is necessary. Whilst
most companies do invest in cybersecurity, CISO B indicates “that cybersecurity
investment needs to be taken a lot seriously by companies”. As such,
cybersecurity is perceived as the barrier to business activities (Li et al., 2019).
Further, the Divisional Head: ICT Governance & Compliance insists, “The
organisation does not review policies, no awareness, no understanding of the
disclaimer for responsibilities. Security is perceived as a tedious act that is not
part of employees’ job descriptions”. CISO B agrees with the negative sentiment
by asserting that “several organisations see security as a nuisance; they do not
see it as delivering in their value chain”. Organisations should conduct costbenefit or rate of return analysis to enable improved investments thus avoiding
over or under investments to cybersecurity (Chronopoulos et al., 2017; Rowe &
Gallaher, 2006).
On a positive note, CISO A perceives cybersecurity “…as the standard of living
and more organisations are beginning to appreciate the impact of secure practice
to protect their revenue. It is a reality every organisation must ensure it fully
understands its implications”. The Executive Manager: Enterprise Architecture,
IT Governance, Risk and Compliance concurs “cyber touches many realms in
daily operation, with the increase in digitalisation, organisations are likely to be
exposed to cyber vulnerabilities. It is important to take care of cybersecurity as
lack thereof has significant implications for the organisation”. Cybersecurity can
affect reputation, revenue generation and profits resulting in increased costs that
affect innovative ideas to keep customers loyal (Shackelford et al., 2015). This
suggests that cybersecurity must be addressed at the strategic level in order to
ensure the attainment of business objectives. The CIO supports the view that
suggests that cyber “...is a necessity for organisations to continue to operate
sustainably, therefore, cybersecurity is survival and it makes good sense to
protect assets as cyber incidents can close down the company if left unattended”.
69
CISO A contends, “Traditional way of conducting training and awareness such
as email communication cannot be measured”. In support of this assertion, the
Principal Specialist adds, “traditional methods are no longer giving desired results
that the company needs. Furthermore, email communication alone is not effective
and not measurable. Online assessments are becoming a norm wherein the level
of employee awareness can be measured”. The Client Manager: Cyber Risk and
Risk Consulting support this view by stating that “there has to be education
preferably E-learning to people dealing with infrastructure”. Since according to
Head of IT, “Cybersecurity is about securing infrastructure to prevent hackers
from accessing systems or applications.” Gaming can be an effective tool to drive
and measure the level of understanding of cybersecurity awareness among
employees (Hendrix et al., 2016). The IT Audit Manager adds, “face to face
awareness training to employees where employees can ask questions is one of
the effective methods to drive good behaviour amongst employees”. The
Principal Specialist posits, “Effective cybersecurity awareness campaigns involve
interacting directly with end-users”. Alternative delivery methods include
dissemination of content through various channels as well as face to face
presentations to drive effective awareness programmes (Abawajy, 2014).
To solidify the importance of cybersecurity awareness at the tactical level, the
Information Security Manager from the telecommunications organisation that has
continental and global operations argues, “Cybersecurity is important in ensuring
the protection of organisational assets which can be attained by implementing
and having a cybersecurity awareness programme”. At the strategic level,
Executive Manager: Enterprise Architecture, IT Governance, Risk, and
Compliance from a publicly owned logistics entity supports the view and augment
“it is critical to have cybersecurity to secure organisational assets as
cybersecurity ensure organisations maintain the protection of customer‘s
information at all time”. Furthermore, at the tactical level, the IT Audit Manager
from the national regulator insists, “Cybersecurity is important due to frequent
processing of information by organisations delivering a service to customers thus
important for a business to operate securely”. Securing organisational assets
requires a combination of cybersecurity technology as well as resources such as
human and financial to attain business-wide strategic goals (Posey et al., 2015).
70
The CIO concludes, “It is a necessity for organisations to continue to operate
sustainably, therefore, cybersecurity is survival and it makes good sense to
protect assets as Cyber incidents can close down the company”.
At the tactical level, there is resonance in terms of the responsibility to distribute
communication content and make employees aware of cybersecurity within the
organisation. Both the IT Audit Manager and the Principal Specialist suggests
that a representative within IT must ensure effective cybersecurity awareness
takes place frequently. Hence, the Head of IT from a publicly owned entity states,
“The organisation conducts quarterly awareness programme to educate endusers to drive behaviour”. Strategically, the CIO points out, “Organisation has an
awareness programme that is running every year. It is compulsory that the
organisation embarks on to increase the level of awareness”. For awareness to
be effective, the CIO suggests, “EXCO team must be the advocate of this
initiative. There must be an element of fun people as employees win prices. The
program runs continuously and the message must continuously change to ensure
effectiveness. The organisation does themes around phishing, ransomware,
secure practices, etc.”
Effective cybersecurity is not without challenges within an organisation. The
Executive Manager: Enterprise Architecture, IT Governance, Risk and
Compliance points out challenges with cybersecurity “many users are not
cybersecurity savvy i.e. user receiving a phishing email and clicking on the link
and get compromised”. However, the CIO insists, “phishing attacks are
proactively identified in his organisation” highlighting approaches to counter
phishing attacks by organisations. There is a general resonance at the strategic
level about the need to educate users as the CIO state “employees need to be
aware of cyber risks as the weakness is the people”. Head of IT agrees, “An
organisation can protect the data from external threats however individuals within
an organisation can compromise the organisation”. Client Manager adds, “It is
crucial to educate the end-user as they are easy targets”. As such, the human
element is the weakest link and requires undivided attention in terms of training
and education to ensure that the cybersecurity program delivers the desired
results (Pfleeger et al., 2014).
71
It appears that the strategic viewpoint varies from the tactical viewpoint. In
isolation, CISO B from the ICT industry suggests, “Cybersecurity is moving from
technical focus areas to be strategic where companies are adopting cyber
strategies as it is a business risk. Board seeing cybersecurity as strategic is long
overdue” thus illustrating support at the right level of decision-making. CISO B
posits “At the principle level, it is important to run the security awareness
programme for users to understand what is allowed or not. It’s important that
security technology must be clear to end-users”. In support of CISO B's assertion
of cybersecurity being strategic imperative, the Client Manager: Cyber Risk and
Risk Consulting agree with the narrative to compare and contrast it with the
developed countries. Client Manager contends, “Cybersecurity is a key strategic
risk in the developed territories as well as in countries where technology is
advance” suggesting that South African organisations can learn lessons from
their counterparts in other territories.
Emphasis must be to outline strategic priorities and directions, organisations
must establish clear plans guided by vision and mission as well setting realistic
strategic objectives that can be achieved over a period of time (Borum et al.,
2015). The Client Manager further state “South Africa is ranked as having the
most people affected by cyber-crime in the world. It means that many people
within the country do not understand the implications of the lack of understanding
of cybersecurity”.
Review of literature confirms that South Africa is ranked third world-over as a
country where most people are experiencing cybercrime (Gcaza & Solms, 2017).
Therefore, the Client Manager concludes that to ensure effective cybersecurity
awareness, “Educate the Executive Committee (EXCO), Management
Committee (MANCO) as well as people on the ground for the content to have a
significant impact”. In agreement with the Client Manager, CISO A emphasised,
“the need to educate executive to gain necessary buy-in”. To get executive
management buy-in, simple and clear articulation of cybersecurity value add to
business operations is a requirement suggesting to avoid technical jargon (B. von
Solms & von Solms, 2018).
72
In conclusion, holistically, the responses seemed positive with few respondents
noting negative sentiments in terms of the importance of effective cybersecurity
awareness. Overwhelmingly, out of ten respondents nine (90%) demonstrated
positive sentiment towards the importance of awareness of cybersecurity
technology and the benefits to their respective organisations. Only one (10%)
respondent appeared to have a negative view about the state of awareness at
their organisation.
It appeared there is a need for organisations to make end-users aware of
cybersecurity to effectively mitigate the risks. To ensure effective cybersecurity
awareness, the suggestion of various mechanisms took place. Mechanisms
included gaming to keep employees engaged, online training such as E-learning
and surveys that are measurable, as well as face-to-face presentations. Thus,
the relationship between effective cybersecurity practices and the level of enduser understanding of cybersecurity is crucial in protecting organisational assets.
It seems organisations in all sectors consider lack of security awareness as a
concern. Perception of the human element as the weakest link requires attention
in terms of training and education to ensure that the cybersecurity program
delivers the desired results. As such, end-users are an important shield in
ensuring effective identification and prevention of cyber risks. Acknowledging
various organisational levels, effective cybersecurity awareness requires a
strategic approach to obtain management buy-in.
Lack of management buy-in resulted in the perception of cybersecurity as a
barrier to business activities. As such, cybersecurity interventions must occur at
the strategic level in order to drive change and ensure the attainment of business
objectives. In order to obtain management buy-in and the board, simple and clear
articulation of cybersecurity value add to business operations is a requirement
suggesting to avoid technical jargon. This will ensure that cybersecurity initiatives
get necessary buy-in in terms of human and financial support. Based on the
evidence above, the study confirms the proposition, therefore, the awareness of
effective cybersecurity technology controls complement cyber insurance to
reduce the impact of cyber-attacks in the South Africa industry.
73
4.3 Discussion pertaining to Proposition 2
Proposition 2 pertains to the approach organisations take towards cybersecurity
thus determining support to cyber risk management in the South Africa industry.
This was achieved by designing three interview questions that culminated in the
emerging theme to provide the answer to proposition 2. The below section will
discuss in detail how the organisational approach to cybersecurity determines
management buy-in to manage cyber risk. To support different types of
cybersecurity approaches within an organisation, exploring the linkage between
management buy-in and cyber insurance perception took place.
4.3.1 An organisational approach to managing cyber risk
The exploration of the organisational approach to cybersecurity determines the
extent of management buy-in to make resources available to manage cyber risk
in the South Africa industry. The approach the organisation takes towards
managing cybersecurity risk has a direct link to cyber insurance perception as
such the outcome of interview questions seeks to explore the relationship. Table
7 below illustrates the perceptions of cyber insurance from the sample of 10
professionals from varying industries in South Africa.

Table 7 above highlight the participant’s responses to cyber insurance
perceptions. Similar to Table 6 above, the transformation of raw data to words
necessitated quantitisation (Langa, 2016) to reinforce a deeper understanding of
participants’ experiences (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Overwhelmingly, all
respondents perceived cyber insurance as a mechanism that enables
organisations to transfer the risk of financial loss/liability with cyber-attacks. As
the Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting point out “cyber insurance
pays for liability that emanates from the cyber incident wherein the cyber
insurance pays to fix the incident as well as lawsuits so that the company
resumes operations as soon as possible”. A view supported by the Principal
Specialist that cyber insurance “…covers for loss of productivity in the event of
cyber-attack”. Further, the Head of IT extends, “Cyber insurance enables the
organisation to cover financial losses and maintain access to data in the event
the organisation is hacked or attacked”. However, CISO A contends that having
cyber insurance “does not necessarily improve security controls” however
supports the view that “it covers financial losses”. Manager: Information Security
caution, “There has to be some kind of synergy between cyber insurance and
control measures implemented by the organisation”. The benefits of cyber
insurance include the shield that could potentially result in financial losses for
organisations emanating from a cyber breach (Camillo, 2017; Franke, 2017)
Considered important, 80% of respondents perceive cyber insurance to
complement an organisation’s cybersecurity measures. Divisional Head: IT
Governance and Compliance highlight the importance of cyber insurance by
stating, “It improves the cybersecurity control environment and transfers the risk
of financial loss/liability associated with cyber-attack to the third party.” CISO B
argues by stating, “Cyber insurance only transfers the financial risk but not
responsibility”. This view is compatible with the IT Audit Manager who states
“cyber insurance complements the existing controls and does not improve
controls therefore organisations can use cyber insurance for compensation in the
event of cyber-attack.” Cyber insurance complements an organisation's
cybersecurity controls in case liability for data breach or loss, remediation costs
such as legal and public relations as well as regulatory fines/penalties and
settlement costs takes place (Hurtaud et al., 2015).
75
The other 60% consider cyber insurance to improve the cyber-security control
environment. The Principal Specialist suggests “Cyber insurance cover ensures
that the business gets to operate in the shortest period after the breach thereby
revenue preservation”. Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting contend,
“Whilst managing risk does not translate to revenue generation, it ensures that
controls are placed to enable the organisation to operate risk-free.” Cyber
insurance plays a significant role in enhancing cybersecurity controls within an
organisation (Woods & Simpson, 2017).
Like any initiative, cyber insurance has inherent challenges, as such, 40% of
respondents indicated that there is a challenge with the setting of premiums and
policy coverage. The Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting posit from
a cyber insurance service provider point of view, “Underwriters are starting to
exclude cyber incidents to their covers as it is challenging for actuarial
professionals to determine the risk premium” highlighting a need to unpack risk
premium to determine what’s covered and excluded. The lack of historical
information to enable efficient cyber insurance product pricing (Tøndel et al.,
2015) thus coverage tend to be expensive with numerous policy exclusions
(Peters et al., 2018).
Interestingly, none of the respondents indicated a lack of explainable
understanding of cyber insurance, which suggests that the sample has
knowledge, experience, and understanding of the cyber insurance phenomenon.
As the CIO put it “With the sophistication of cybercrime, companies are forced to
have cyber insurance. It is about when they will the hackers get to your network.
You will never be 100% insured”. Therefore, cyber insurance addresses the
residual after the implementation of cybersecurity control measures (S. Shetty et
al., 2018).
Next, based on the responses from participants in terms of organisational
cybersecurity approach, responses implied two approaches i.e. top-down and
bottom-up wherein management support could be proactive or reactive. Table 8
below illustrates the link between cybersecurity approach and management
support that determines the extent to which cyber risk is managed within an
organisation. 
76
Table 8: Cybersecurity approach and management support
Cyber Security
Approach
Management
Support Responses Ratio
Top-down Proactive 6 60%
Top-down Reactive 3 30%
Bottom-up Reactive 1 10%
Total 10 100%
Table 8 illustrates the relationship between cybersecurity approach in terms of
top-down vs bottom and management support concerning proactive and reactive.
In the context of this study, top-down relates decision-making, goals, objectives,
and actions that are driven from top management to manage cyber risks (Linkov
et al., 2014). Whereas bottom-up is about conducting risk assessments to
influence top management of the organisation to make risk-informed decisions
(Linkov et al., 2014).
In this study, 60% of respondents appeared to lean towards a top-down approach
with proactive management support. The Manager: Information Security state
“the objective of cybersecurity is to mitigate the risk that the organisation faces
on a daily basis therefore the organisation takes cyber risk management serious
to protect assets”. In addition, “There is management support wherein the
Information Security Risk Committee is established to proactively deal with
technology issues” which indicates that the organisation is proactive in decisionmaking in terms of cyber risk tolerance. As reflected in the organisation’s risk
appetite statement, the IT Audit Manager emphasises “the risk register is the
driving force to determine cyber risk tolerance levels.” The organisation must,
therefore, ensure that attainable goals are set with adequate capability to counter
the effects of cyber risks thus enhanced business outcomes (Cherdantseva et
al., 2016; Johnson, 2015).
In line with top-down proactive management support, the Executive Manager:
Enterprise Architecture, IT Governance, Risk, and Compliance state, “A function
that deals with cybersecurity exists with a structure that comprises of experts on
cybersecurity.” The IT Audit Manager views “the separate establishment of an
information security function as necessary to ensure accountability”. Highlighting
the importance of best practice frameworks the Head of IT indicates that 
77
cybersecurity “…is approached at the high level i.e. policies, standards that
support security ISO 27001/2, frameworks to obtain guidance by implementing
an end-to-end cybersecurity programme to minimise cybersecurity breach and
continuously improve on measures”. To emphasise the point, the Executive
Manager highlight “Cyber risk is supported across the entire organisation and all
the way to the board”. CISO B advises, “The board must own the risk and not
transfer it to insurance” to monitor the status of cyber risk in the organisation and
take proactive decisions in the interest of the organisation. The Principal
Specialist adds, “The Audit Committee has an item where cyber risks are
discussed because of the importance.” Suggesting that the board is paying
attention to cyber risk thus takes place at the highest level of the company.
Organisations that have established board committees are less likely to breached
as cyber risks are proactively mitigated through early detection and response thus
adding value to business operations (Higgs et al., 2016). Whilst the management
of cybersecurity is everyone’s business within an organisation, the board has the
responsibility to provide oversight thus long-term sustainability of an organisation
(Rothrock et al., 2018). The Client Manager advises, “It is important for the
CIO/CISO to communicate clearly in terms of the human and financial resources
needed, timeframe and benefits to the organisation” highlighting that
cybersecurity and associated risk get attention at the board and C-suite level.
Further, proactive management support “… comes with educating the C-suite
and impact assessments are necessary to guide CEOs. They must be
empowered to make decisions that are in the best interest of the organisation”.
In terms of the risk register, the Executive Manager indicated, “A risk register
exists to track the implementation of risks with automatic escalations if certain
risks are not being adequately managed”. This proactive approach seems to be
supported by the Head of IT who highlights “Due to recent attacks on South
African companies, implementation of security measures have received top
management attention” suggesting human and financial resources are allocated
commensurate with the risk of the organisation faces. Whilst the organisation
approaches cybersecurity from a top-down perspective, the Principal Specialist
has a different view that suggests “The management support is there although a 
78
lot is still required in terms of financial and human resources that are needed”
suggesting that resources are required to mitigate the cyber risks. The Client
Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting appreciate organisational constraints
by acknowledging “budget spend can be an issue to some organisations however
it is crucial to priorities activities on the roadmap.”
Since cybersecurity is high on the board agenda list, sufficient resources must be
provided to adequately manage cyber risks (Johnson, 2015). The Principal
Specialist also acknowledges the effect of cyber-attacks in South Africa and
posits, “due to the recent media coverage on the effect of cybersecurity incidents,
cybersecurity is getting more attention”. The CIO concludes, “Cybersecurity
takes precedence for example it receives attention from the Managing Director’s
office.” Suggesting that management of cybersecurity risks receives attention
from the highest level of the organisation to ensure that all staff is on board and
therefore understand their role in cyber defence (Islam & Stafford, 2017).
Next, 30% of respondents indicated their organisations approach cybersecurity
in the top-down however reactive fashion. The Divisional Head: ICT Governance
and Compliance indicated that at the metropolitan municipality “Influential
stakeholders such as Enterprise Risk and Internal Audit are utilised as they carry
weight” suggesting the type of approach the organisation takes towards
managing cybersecurity. From a managed ICT service point of view, CISO B
states “organisations are advised to adopt and implement best practice
frameworks such as ISO27000 standards as a guide to Information Security
Management system”.
There appears to be minimal management support where the organisation’s
perception is reactive. For instance, the Divisional Head: ICT Governance and
Compliance postulate, “Cybersecurity is perceived as burdensome” highlighting
the lack of management support for cybersecurity initiatives in this organisation.
This view correlates with the negative sentiment that cybersecurity perception as
the barrier to business activities at the metropolitan municipality. The reactive
approach towards cyber risk symbolises that in several organisations
cybersecurity is seen as a disruption to business operations (Lewis, 2014). CISO
B believes that the approach to cybersecurity depends on the type of leadership 
79
within the organisation. CISO B contends “It is very much dependent on who the
leader and to what extent they have the understanding and appreciation of the
impact of cybersecurity i.e. if the CEO is aware of cybersecurity, then
cybersecurity initiatives get supported.”
The Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting observe from a customer
perspective that cyber risk “…usually falls into the CIO or CISO purview”. To get
management support the Client Manager suggests that EXCO must be “...fully
aware of cyber risks thereby cascading the message from EXCO, MANCO and
down to the people on the ground.” Further, “Oftentimes employers don’t
appreciate cybersecurity; they see it as a tick box exercise as opposed to
strategic value add. With effective management support, cybersecurity can
defend the organisation's income stream, customer satisfaction, and loyalty.”
Representing the remaining 10% of respondents wherein organisations indicated
bottom-up approach that is reactive, CISO A from a multinational Beverage
company state “The organisation uses project-based approach from the
operational and tactical point of view” illustrating the limited extent of existence
of management support in this organisation. In this approach, the organisation’s
prioritise cybersecurity initiatives based on set metrics and report on benefits
realised on investments (Moore et al., 2015). As opposed to an operational
project-based view, the IT Audit Manager posits “…organisation approaches
cybersecurity from strategic planning then cascaded down the value chain by
implementing controls in a project-based approach” which suggests that the
organisation's top-down approach is proactive.
Cybersecurity has earned its place in the boardrooms of most organisations and
executives consider it as a strategic risk that could negatively impact company
earnings if left unattended (Newmeyer, 2015). The Client Manager: Cyber Risk
and Risk Consulting are of the view that “cybersecurity must link to organisational
strategy, corporate governance and enterprise risk management to be fully
effective in an organisation.” The CIO states “Cybersecurity strategy is embedded
in the organisational strategy as a strategic imperative” highlighting sufficient
attention from top management.
80
In terms of management support, CISO A suggests, “Support is there due to fear
of not knowing what cyber risk is about and limited funding to carry out initiatives
which suggest minimal management support.” In opposition, the IT Audit
Manager advises that whilst there is management support at his organisation, “it
is insufficient as there is no dedicated resource responsible for cybersecurity on
a daily basis.” CISO A is of the view that the structure contributes to how cyber
risk is managed as such “cyber risk is seen as slowing down business” and
therefore the organisation is reactive towards cyber risk management (Lewis,
2014). CISO B supports this view by stating, “Organisations are mostly reactive.”
With the increase of cyber-attacks, there should be more efforts to protect
information and business systems (Brangetto & Aubyn, 2015).
The Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting assert “South Africa is very
ignorant around cyber risk understanding whereas in developed territories
understand of cyber risk has matured” implying they are cyber risk resilient to
protect revenues (Elmarie Kritzinger & Von Solms, 2012). Further, from the
service provider point of view, the Client Manager postulate “South African
companies tend to be reactive towards risk assessments” as such companies
should be proactive to ensure sound cybersecurity posture to manage cyber risk
at the right level of decision making within an organisation (Higgs et al., 2016).
The CIO concludes, “The organisation keeps abreast of what is happening in the
market and industry in terms of cyber risks thus staying ahead of the curve.”
In conclusion, overwhelmingly, all respondents considered cyber insurance as a
mechanism that enables organisations to transfer the risk of financial loss/liability
associated with cyber-attacks. It appears that respondents perceive the benefits
of cyber insurance to safeguard against financial losses for organisations
emanating from cyber breaches as well as complementing the organisation’s
cybersecurity measures. Cyber insurance shields against data breach or loss,
remediation costs such as legal and public relations as well as regulatory
fines/penalties and settlement costs takes place. It appears that lack of historical
information in the context of South Africa results in a challenge to price risk
premium.
81
Seemingly, the link between cybersecurity approach and management support
determines the extent to which cyber risk management occurs within an
organisation. The cybersecurity approach can be either top-down or bottom
wherein top-down pertains to decision-making or bottom-up pertains to risk
assessments. In this study, 60% of respondents appeared to lean towards a topdown approach with proactive management support.
Organisations that have top-down cybersecurity approach and proactive
management support have institutionalised risk register driven by organisational
risk appetite and risk committee to provide accountability and oversight,
communication of cyber risks as well as organisational structures. Organisations
that are top-down and proactive seem to have boards that have cyber risk as a
top agenda item thereby enhanced revenue streams, customer loyalty, and brand
reputation. It appears such boards provide sufficient human and financial
resources to manage cyber risks from the highest level of the organisation to
ensure that all staff is aware. Therefore, the staff understands their role in cyber
defence. Perception of organisations that have established board committees is
less likely to be attacked as cyber risks are proactively mitigated through timely
discovery and reaction thus long sustainability.
Further, 30% of respondents indicated their organisations approach
cybersecurity in the top-down however reactive fashion. There appears to be
minimal management support where the organisation’s perception is reactive.
There seems to be a correlation between the lack of management support for
cybersecurity initiatives and cybersecurity perception as the barrier to business
activities. It seems reactive approach links with lack of awareness towards cyber
risk which symbolises cybersecurity is seen as a burden.
Further, reactive management support is linked with the extent to which executive
management understands cyber risk. Suggesting that cybersecurity awareness
must be intensified at top management and the message cascaded to staff on
the ground to defend income streams, customer loyalty, and brand reputation.
The remaining 10% of respondents represent organisations that indicated a
bottom-up approach and reactive management support. These organisations 
82
seem to not drive cyber risk management from a strategic level instead they react
to events as they happen. Seemingly, this was prevalent to organisations that do
not have structures to monitor and mitigate cyber risks on a frequent basis. As
such, this option could result in a negative impact on company earnings. In line
with the analysis, the study confirms the proposition, therefore, the organisational
approach to cybersecurity determines cyber-risk management support.
4.4 Discussion pertaining to Proposition 3
In this section, the relationship between the need for organisations to comply with
various government legislations and the cyber insurance adoption takes place.
Further, the manner in which an organisation perceives cyber insurance
determines organisational appetite for adoption. The research study explored the
perceptions per sector to determine the drivers for cyber insurance adoption in
South Africa industry.
4.4.1 Cyber insurance adoption in South Africa industry
The findings of cyber insurance in the South African industry reveals interesting
outcomes. During the interview process, participants were asked to indicate
whether they have adopted cyber insurance in their respective industries. Table
9 below illustrates the status of cyber adoption from the purposefully selected
sample of 10 professionals in the South African industry.
Table 9: Cyber insurance adoption
Cyber Insurance Adoption
Status Response Ratio
Adopted 5 50%
Not
Adopted 5 50%
Total 10 100%
As shown in Table 9, out of 10 respondents, 50% indicated that they have
adopted cyber insurance in their organisation meanwhile the other 50% indicated
that cyber insurance adoption has not occurred in their organisations. Table 10 
83
below illustrates the comparison of cyber insurance adoption by sector and
industry.

This represents 40% public whereas 60% constitute private sector organisations
that have adopted cyber insurance. Two Respondents namely Divisional Head:
ICT Governance & Risk and CIO from Metropolitan Municipality and Financial
Services industries, respectively, represented public sector organisations that
indicated cyber insurance adoption. To understand the rationale, the Divisional
Head stated, “50% of financial loss has been insured through a cyber insurance
service provider based on the risk appetite defined by the enterprise risk
management”. Interestingly, the Divisional Head had earlier indicated that the
organisation is proactive in terms of cybersecurity however, it lacks management
support to drive cyber risk management. The Divisional Head postulate, “In
general, few government institutions have adopted cyber insurance. This
municipality could be the first in the public sector.”
Further, the CIO noting the importance of cyber insurance “…that it gets the
organisation to operations quicker after cyber-attack has taken place” highlighting
that the organisation considered potential cybersecurity incident and structured
cyber insurance adoption along those lines. From a cyber insurance provider
point of view, the Client Manager argues, “Most South African organisations are
not proactive as they seek cyber insurance cover after an attack has occurred”.
Further, the Client Manager poses a question “From a government point of view,
what will the hacker do when they get access to citizen information? The
collection, storage, and processing of citizens sensitive data that resides on 
84
information systems present an opportunity for attackers to launch cyber-attacks
on public institutions to disrupt the network and gain unauthorised access to data
(Kesan & Hayes, 2017).
Three respondents namely the Client Manager: Cyber Risk and Risk Consulting,
Manager: Information Security as well as CISO B from Financial Services,
Telecom and ICT industries, respectively, represent private sector organisations
that indicated cyber insurance adoption. Client Manager posits, “cyber insurance
is necessary since most organisations are data driven in terms Artificial
Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things, etc.” highlighting the need to protect
data as well the link between cyber insurance and emerging digital technologies
(Huang et al., 2018). Unpacking the driver for cyber insurance adoption in the
Telecom organisation, the Manager: Information Security contends, “Business
must operate all the time” suggesting cybersecurity controls complement cyber
insurance to manage cyber risk.
Warning potential buyers, CISO B highlights buyers and cyber insurance provider
responsibilities stating, “Buyers must be a lot more informed, implement cyber
essentials before signing a cyber insurance policy” as the repudiation of claim
can occur if there is sufficient proof that there were no effective controls.
Extending further, “cyber insurance service providers must explain in simple
terms the provisions of policy cover” highlighting the need to engage
cybersecurity specialists to fully understand what is being bought and value it has
on business.
However, in the context of South Africa, there seems to be a slow uptake of cyber
insurance adoption. The Client Manager concludes, “South African corporates do
not understand the risk and what cover they need” thus an opportunity for
insurance companies to educate potential clients on their product offering. The
level of cyber insurance adoption needs to mature in South Africa to ensure
resilience from cyber incidents that are occurring at an alarming rate (Woods &
Simpson, 2017).
Overwhelmingly on both public and private sectors of the South African industry,
government legislations seem to influence cyber insurance adoption. Divisional 
85
Head indicated, “The metropolitan municipality is highly regulated and must
comply with various legislations such as POPI, RICA, MFMA, etc.” A view shared
by Manager: Information Security “Relevant legislation include but not limited to
POPI, RICA, GDPR, etc.” highlighting the organisation’s readiness to ensuring
processes are compliant to protect customer data. CISO B explains that as a
managed service company operating in South Africa, “regulations such as
GDPR, POPI, etc. are relevant; however, the organisation also operates in global
markets where GDPR is relevant such EU. Similarly, with Client Manager "The
organisation is Multinational Corporation based in Chicago, London and
Johannesburg. In SA, legislation is the driver for cyber insurance adoption thus
the organisation adheres to King 4, POPI, etc. In other territories that the
organisation operates in, as a Lead Risk Advisor and Lead Insurance Broker
globally it must comply with relevant laws and regulations”. Companies operating
in South Africa have a duty to protect customer data in line with the provisions of
the POPI act (Swartz & Da Veiga, 2016).
In terms of the five organisations that indicated to have not adopted cyber
insurance, three (60%) represent the public sector and the remaining two (40%)
represent the private sector. Respondents include the IT Audit Manager,
Executive Manager: Enterprise Architecture, IT Governance, Risk, and
Compliance as well as Head of IT who represents the regulator, state-owned
logistics and publicly owned financial services industries, respectively, from the
public sector.
Noting the importance of cyber insurance, the IT Audit Manager states “Cyber
insurance has not been adopted yet which the organisation must look into. With
increasing cyber-attacks, cyber insurance can provide a financial shield.”
Suggesting the lack of accountability or ownership of cyber risks in terms of
government regulations in this organisation. The Executive Manager
acknowledges, “That it is impossible to mitigate all possible cyber risks.”
Signifying that risks that are prevalent in cyber space warrants cyber insurance
thus it is “unlikely that all cyber risks can be mitigated”.
Further, the argument “Cyber insurance reduces the effects of cyber-attacks on
organisations thereby business continuity.” This illustrates the criticality of cyber 
86
insurance, yet “Cyber insurance has not been adopted, however, the organisation
has adopted other insurance covers such as logistics, goods, machinery, and
locomotives in line with core operational functions of the organisation.” The Head
of IT indicates, “The organisation complies with all government rules and
regulations in South Africa.” However, “cyber insurance has not been adopted”,
as a compensating control “internal best practices such as COBIT 5 as well as
legislation such as POPI are adopted by the organisation.”
In addition, the Executive Manager state, “The organisation complies with rail
safety regulations which are linked to operating licence.” The Executive Manager
concludes, “POPI may not be a factor for this organisation. POPI is more on staff
medical records ensuring fit to drive a train.” Companies operating in South Africa
must take precautions to protect the privacy for individual’s data in their control
and ensure compliance with the POPI act (Scharnick et al., 2016).
The remaining two respondents namely CISO A and Principal Specialist
represent the Beverages and Manufacturing industries, respectively, from the
South African private sector. CISO A concedes that cyber insurance is quite new
in the South African industry arguing, “Few organisations have adopted the cyber
insurance”. CISO A states “currently organisations are not investing in the
acquisition of cyber insurance however there is likely to be an increase in cyber
insurance as cyber-attacks on organisations gets advanced and legislations such
as POPI get introduced.” Principal Specialist concurs with CISO A by stating
“Cyber insurance is new territory, actuarial scientists are finding it difficult to set
up the premiums thus not easy to quantify the premium. Cyber insurance is still
new in the industry, even insurance companies are able not to price premium
correctly, to determine what is covered and not covered. There seems to be
uniformity on the lack of knowledge around cyber insurance, suggesting that
cyber insurance provider must educate potential buyers on product offerings and
various options. CISO A points out “There is still a shortage of cyber security skills
in SA however no effort from organisations to improve the skillset. This could be
the motivation for cyber insurance adoption.” CISO B whose organisation has
adopted cyber insurance insists, “Controls must be in place whether cyber 
87
insurance is there or not. Over and above cyber insurance adoption,
organisations must emphasise on the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls.”
Whilst cyber insurance adoption has not materialised, CISO A notes cyber
insurance importance by stating, “Cyber insurance assists businesses against
cyber-attacks by insuring against loss, reputation as well as profit thereby
protecting the organisation against losses.” Head of IT agrees “…that cyber
insurance assists in protecting the reputation of the organisation.” In terms of
government legislation, CISO A and Principal Specialist’s organisations are
multinational corporations. As such, Principal Specialist contends, “…there is a
lot of regulation to comply. Locally, it is POPI, Cybercrime Bill, ECT Act, etc.
Globally it includes GPDPR, Sarbanes Oxley (US)” This suggests that the
organisation operates in a highly regulated environment. Therefore, the
organisation has insurance for company assets, “however cyber insurance has
not been adopted”. CISO A elaborates that the organisation complies with various
regulations.
Further, “Since the organisation is global, compliance with POPI, GDPR and
other applicable laws comes from multiple regions”. However, in the South
African subsidiary, “there are no dedicated resources responsible for legal and
regulatory compliance”. CISO A concludes, “There is no appetite for cyber
insurance adoption in this organisation. The organisational processes are not
mature.” Advising that if there was a cyber-attack there could be a financial loss.
Therefore, more education is required to understand what value cyber insurance
can add to the organisations as it appears the organisations have invested in
technology and not in cyber insurance.
In conclusion, out of 10 respondents, 50% indicated that they have adopted cyber
insurance in their organisation meanwhile the other 50% indicated that cyber
insurance adoption has not occurred in their organisations. Organisations who
have adopted cyber insurance represents 40% public and 60% private.
Organisations that have adopted cyber insurance perceive it as important as it
gets the organisation quicker to operations after a breach. 
88
However, in the context of South Africa, there seems to be a slow uptake of cyber
insurance adoption. Thus, an opportunity for insurance companies to educate
potential clients on their product offering. Overwhelmingly on both public and
private sectors of the South African industry, government legislations seem to
influence cyber insurance adoption. The majority of respondents indicated that
applicable South African laws included but not limited to POPI, RICA, MFMA,
KING 4, Cybercrime Bill and ECT, etc. thus becoming the driver for cyber
insurance adoption. Multinational organisations cited GDPR (UK) and Sarbanes
Oxley (US) as applicable in other territories where they operate.
In terms of the five organisations that indicated to have not adopted cyber
insurance, three (60%) represent the public sector and the remaining two (40%)
represent the private sector. Interestingly, organisations that have not adopted
cyber insurance all acknowledge the importance of cyber insurance suggesting
that risks that are prevalent in cyberspace warrants cyber insurance.
Most respondents seem to suggest that cyber insurance is quite new in the South
African industry arguing that pricing for risk premium as the main challenge as
well as not understanding what is covered. Proposing the need to engage and
collaborate with cybersecurity specialists to fully understand what cyber
insurance covers and the value it has on business. There seems to be uniformity
on the lack of knowledge around cyber insurance, suggesting that cyber
insurance provider must educate potential buyers on product offerings and
various options. There appears to be an increased likelihood of financial losses
for organisations that have not adopted cyber insurance. As such, more
education is required to understand what value cyber insurance can add to the
organisations as it appears the organisations have invested in technology and
not in cyber insurance. Therefore, compliance with regulations enables
organisations to adopt cyber insurance in the South Africa industry to reduce the
risk of financial losses associated with cyber breaches.
89
4.5 Conclusion
Chapter 4, Findings and Discussion provided insightful analysis and
interpretation of findings from the sample of 10 respondents. Alignment of
objectives, propositions, interview research questions culminated to the
emergence of the following three themes:
a) Effective cybersecurity awareness
b) An organisational approach to managing cyber risk
c) Cyber insurance adoption in South Africa industry
The research found that to have effective cybersecurity awareness, boards and
executive management must drive change as a strategic imperative, support the
initiatives through human and financial resources as well as cascade
communication to staff on the ground. Indeed, the awareness of effective
cybersecurity technology controls complement cyber insurance to reduce the
impact of cyber-attacks in the South Africa industry.
The study found a link between cybersecurity approach and management
support that determines the extent to which cyber risk management occurs within
an organisation. Organisations that have top-down cybersecurity approach and
proactive management support have institutionalised risk register driven by
organisational risk appetite and risk committee to provide accountability and
oversight, communication of cyber risks as well as organisational structures.
There appears to be minimal management support where the organisation’s
perception is reactive. There seems to be a correlation between the lack of
management support for cybersecurity initiatives and cybersecurity perception as
the barrier to business activities. It seems reactive approach links with lack of
awareness towards cyber risk which symbolises cybersecurity is seen as a
burden. Therefore, organisational approach to cybersecurity determines cyberrisk management support.
The study found a 50/50 split between organisations who have adopted cyber
insurance and those who have not adopted cyber insurance. The majority of
organisations who have adopted cyber insurance represents public sector (60%) 
90
and the remaining 40% represents the public sector. The biggest driver of
adoption of cyber insurance for both public and private sector organisation is
government legislation which includes but not limited to POPI, RICA, MFMA,
KING 4, Cybercrime Bill and ECT.
here seems to be uniformity on the lack of knowledge around cyber insurance,
advising that cyber insurance provider must educate potential buyers on product
offerings and various options. There appears to be an increased likelihood of
financial losses for organisations that have not adopted cyber insurance. As such,
more education is required to understand what value cyber insurance can add to
the organisations as it appears the organisations have invested in technology and
not in cyber insurance.
In conclusion, a combination of effective cybersecurity awareness, organisational
approach to managing cyber risk and compliance with government legislations
are factors influencing cyber insurance adoption in the South African industry to
reduce the risk of financial losses associated with cyber breaches.
91
CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 Introduction
The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors influencing cyber
insurance adoption in South Africa industry. Cyberspace inherently has cyber
risks that result in cyber-breaches in the event cybersecurity measures are
inadequate. Even with the most sophisticated cybersecurity defence arsenal,
cyber-breaches can still occur. Thus, cyber insurance manages residual risk after
the implementation of cybersecurity controls. Cyber insurance can provide a
financial shield to ensure business resume operations post cyber breach in the
South Africa industry.
The research objective was to investigate factors influencing cyber insurance
adoption in the South Africa industry from the perspective of technology,
organisation, and environment (TOE). To discover factors influencing cyber
insurance adoption, the study employed the TOE framework as the basis for
exploration leading to an intensive literature review. The review of the literature
resulted in the formulation of three propositions in line with TOE. The literature
revealed the importance of effective cybersecurity, the relationship between the
organisational approach to cybersecurity and management support. Further, a
review of literature established that organisations adopt cyber insurance to
transfer the risk of financial liability to the third party thereby improved compliance
with government regulations.
The study employed a qualitative research method using semi-structured
interviews as an instrument to collect data in order to address the research
problem. The coding and categorisation of data enabled the analysis of the
emerging themes. The study employed saturation, triangulation, and quantitising
leading to the systemic interpretation and presentation of data. Data presentation
employed a combination of words and tables to support the three propositions.
The chapter then concluded with findings confirming propositions using the
utmost ethical standards thus ensuring credibility and transferability of the study.
The remainder of this chapter integrates findings from the previous chapter with 
92
research objectives. Finally, the presentation of recommendations and
suggestions for further research occurs.
5.2 Conclusions regarding research objective 1
Factoring cybersecurity awareness as part of the day-to-day work yields desired
outcomes for the organisation. To ensure effective cybersecurity awareness,
organisations must be proactive and awareness should not be a once-off event.
Organisations must create awareness to educate end-users about the risks
associated with unsecured practices. Organisations must keep on educating
employees and ensuring that employees are kept engaged through exciting
content that they are able to relate as cyber threats are becoming more
sophisticated. Examples include ensuring that staff is well trained up on the clean
desk policy, understanding why the awareness is necessary and inform
employees about the various social engineering threats they should lookout.
Employees must be cautious when opening suspicious emails/links.
It is critical to have cybersecurity to secure organisational assets. Organisations
must be aware of the risks on all the layers of cyberspace thus important to run
the security awareness programme on a continuous basis. It is crucial for users
to understand what is allowed or not and that cybersecurity risks are clear to endusers. An online security programme should have a technical element to help
improve the security posture of an organisation. To ensure effectiveness,
cybersecurity must begin at the board and top management levels to drive
change. This plays a big role in driving awareness and getting buy-in, which in
turn informs the amount of airtime that cybersecurity gets in the organisation.
Therefore, organisations in South Africa seem to have low maturity when it comes
to effective cybersecurity awareness
5.3 Conclusions regarding research objective 2
With the increase of cyber-attacks, there should be more efforts to protect
information assets by organisations in South Africa. Cyber insurance is quite new
and few organisations have entered the cyber insurance space thus it is not 
93
mature yet. Having cyber insurance does not necessarily improve security
controls however it covers financial losses. Cyber insurance only transfers the
financial risk but not responsibility. Behavioural risk management is required as
opposed to the current blanket approach to cyber risk management.
Organisations must ensure there is sufficient budgeting, allocate resources such
as people and operate effectively to manage the ever-increasing cyber risks.
Implement various solutions in terms of defence in depth and monitoring for cyber
resilience.
Defined cybersecurity strategy forms the basis for cybersecurity risk mitigation
strategies to ensure the successful operationalisation of the cybersecurity
strategy. Effective controls ensure that stakeholders have visibility of security
posture. Organisations must understand the risk and align with best practice
frameworks that are recognised worldwide. Seemingly, organisations that
approach cybersecurity in a proactive manner and have management buy-in tend
to have to sound cybersecurity posture, thus mitigating cyber risks. Cyber risk
management receives sufficient support to ensure successful mitigation, both in
terms of budget allocation and sponsorship in organisations that are proactive
and have management support.
Boards and top management must be empowered to make decisions that are in
the best interest of the organisation. Therefore, it is important for the CIOs/CISOs
to communicate clearly in terms of the resources (human and financial) needed,
timeframe and benefits to the organisation. Organisations must use risk registers
to identify cybersecurity risks, come up with mitigating strategies and implement
countermeasures. Boards must establish a risk committee to oversees and
monitor the process of identifying, assessing and responding to cybersecurity
risks
5.4 Conclusions regarding research objective 3
Organisations in the private sector viewed cyber insurance adoption as one of
the strategies to comply with laws in a competitive way. Meanwhile, organisations
in the public sector seemed to adopt cyber insurance out of fear of the unknown 
94
in terms of legislation. Cyber insurance can help organisations to meet the
requirements of the POPIA and other data protection requirements.
In the context of the South African industry, emerging legislations such as POPI
and to some extent for organisations that have global operations seem to propel
executive buy-in. This is an angle in which cybersecurity buy-in to the executives
as a business imperative and not a nice to have. Cyber insurance adoption should
only occur after cybersecurity controls are in place not when there are gaps. It
must not be a tick box exercise. Cyber insurance providers must partner with
cybersecurity specialists to arrive at better premiums. Organisations should have
controls at a reasonable level, thereafter consideration of cyber insurance policy
needs to fit for purpose. There must be ongoing/continuous improvement in cyber
risk management. Most attacks are happening due to weak controls on web
applications. As such, basics from design, implementation, monitoring must be in
place.
Buyers must be a lot more informed, implement cyber essentials before signing
a cyber policy. It is important to engage cybersecurity specialists to fully
understand what is being bought and the value it has on business. Buyers must
be mindful of the terms and conditions i.e. if there are no controls, frameworks
implemented, monitored and continuous improvement, those basics must be in
place. Controls must be in place whether cyber insurance is there or not as a
repudiation of a claim can occur if it can be proven that there were no effective
controls. The board must own the risk and not transfer it to an insurance provider.
Cyber insurance providers must collaborate with cyber specialists to arrive at a
better premium.
On a cost versus benefits scale, the price and cost of buying cybersecurity
insurance will not be viable and will certainly not make business sense if it will
exceed the potential sanctions (penalties and fines) for non-compliance. This is
the principle in which many executives view cybersecurity insurance. It can,
therefore, be deduced that cyber insurance is currently a grudge purchase and in
this study, half of the organisations indicated to have not adopted it.
95
5.5 Recommendations
The adoption of cyber insurance in certain instances raises questions about what
law an organisation can ignore due to the transfer of cyber risk to the cyber
insurance provider. Cyber insurance must be recognised from a strategic point of
view, as such, it is recommended that cybersecurity as function resides with CISO
and not CIO as cyber risk is the last thing on CIO’s mind. When it comes to
cybersecurity, the South African industry should approach it differently. Individual
companies are approaching cybersecurity in a siloed manner.
Digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things; Big Data,
Cloud Computing, and other emerging technologies. are the future. Thus,
requires effective cybersecurity to protect the organisational assets. With the
exception of high-status enterprises such as the City of Johannesburg, Banks,
Liberty, etc. that have recently been attacked by cybercriminals, most entities in
South Africa keep such information to themselves. South African companies must
disclose cyber attacks as well as associated losses as the study found that most
events relate to US and EU countries which were the limitation of this study.
It is recommended that organisations consider the combination of effective
cybersecurity awareness, organisational approach to managing cyber risk and
compliance with government legislations as factors influencing cyber insurance
adoption in the South African industry to reduce the risk of financial losses
associated with cyber breaches.
5.6 Suggestions for further research
The study was limited to the sample of only 10 professionals purposefully
selected to represent public and private sector sentiments on the cyber insurance
phenomenon. For future research, the expansion of the study is necessary to
include more respondents thus enriching the development of knowledge in the
context of South Africa. This will ensure that collected data contains diverse
viewpoints in the South African context. 
96
The cyber insurance is relatively new in South Africa; therefore, future studies
need to focus on both the demand side as well as the supply side. This will result
in the development of knowledge relevant to the South African industry as the
review of literature consisted mostly of cases outside of South Africa.
Future research needs to be conducted on quantification of cyber-attacks to
determine cyber insurance pricing models thus contributing to knowledge
development in this discipline in South Africa and other developing economies.
Further, the examination of the relationship between the organisational approach
to cyber risk and management support as a determinant for cyber insurance
adoption in South Africa needs further scrutiny.
