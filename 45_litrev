# Literature Review: A Novel Approach to the Behavioral Aspects of Cybersecurity

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of technology and the widespread use of the internet have made cyberspace
an inseparable aspect of everyone's life. Cyberspace refers to the online world that is separate from
everyday reality and is characterized by its interconnectedness and digital nature. However, with the
benefits of cyberspace also come various risks and challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity failures can have catastrophic consequences in financial aspects [1]–[6], high-tech industry
[7]–[13], and even life-threatening aspects in healthcare [14]–[20]. In order to mitigate these risks, it is
essential to understand the behavioral aspects of cybersecurity and the role of human factors in ensuring
information security.

## Human Errors and Lack of Knowledge in Cybersecurity

It is well-established that many cybersecurity failures are caused by human errors or their lack of
knowledge. Research has shown that individuals with internet addiction and impulsivity are more likely to
engage in risky cybersecurity behaviors [12]. Moreover, attitudes towards cybersecurity play a significant
role in determining an individual's cybersecurity practices [12]. Understanding the link between internet
addiction, impulsivity, attitudes towards cybersecurity, and risky cybersecurity behaviors can provide
valuable insights into developing effective cybersecurity strategies.

## Incorporating Complexity Science and Information Systems

Complexity science and information systems offer valuable contributions to saving human lives in the
context of cybersecurity. By applying complexity science principles, researchers have been able to better
understand the dynamics of cyberattacks and develop strategies to prevent and mitigate their impact [1].
Information systems, on the other hand, provide the necessary infrastructure and tools for collecting and
analyzing cybersecurity data [1]. By integrating complexity science and information systems, researchers
can gain a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity threats and develop effective countermeasures.

## Design of Secure Water Treatment Systems

The design of secure water treatment systems is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, particularly in the
context of critical infrastructure. Research has demonstrated the importance of developing secure water
treatment systems and has provided datasets to support further research in this area [2]. These datasets can
be used to analyze and evaluate the vulnerabilities of water treatment systems, identify potential cyber
threats, and develop strategies to prevent and respond to cyberattacks.

## Behavioral Graph Matching for Fast Malware Classification

Malware classification is an essential task in cybersecurity, as it allows for the identification and mitigation
of malicious software. Research has proposed a fast malware classification technique based on automated
behavioral graph matching [5]. This approach leverages the behavioral characteristics of malware to
classify and detect potential threats. By incorporating behavioral analysis into malware classification,
researchers can enhance the effectiveness of cybersecurity systems and improve their ability to detect and
mitigate cyber threats.

## Human Factors in Cybersecurity

The role of human factors in cybersecurity has gained significant attention in recent years. Research has
demonstrated the link between internet addiction, impulsivity, attitudes towards cybersecurity, and risky
cybersecurity behaviors [12]. Understanding these behavioral aspects can help develop targeted interventions and training programs to improve cybersecurity practices. Additionally, incorporating human
factors and ergonomics principles in the design of cybersecurity systems can enhance their usability and
effectiveness [18]. By considering human factors, such as cognitive abilities, limitations, and preferences,
researchers can design cybersecurity systems that are intuitive, user-friendly, and promote secure behavior.

## Industrial Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity

The industrial critical infrastructure sector faces numerous cybersecurity challenges. Research has
highlighted the need to address cybersecurity issues in manufacturing and other industrial sectors [8].
Understanding the unique challenges and vulnerabilities of industrial critical infrastructure can inform
the development of tailored cybersecurity strategies. Future research should focus on identifying and
mitigating the specific cybersecurity threats faced by the industrial sector and developing strategies to
enhance the resilience and security of critical infrastructure systems.

## Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in the field of cybersecurity. Research has
explored the use of AI methods for detecting and preventing cybersecurity attacks [11]. Federated learning,
a decentralized AI approach, has shown potential for enhancing cybersecurity [11]. This approach allows
for collaborative learning across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. Further research is
needed to explore the concepts, challenges, and future directions of using AI, including federated learning,
in cybersecurity.

## Prevention of Phishing Attacks Using AI-Based Cybersecurity Awareness Training

Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to information security. Research has investigated the use of
AI-based cybersecurity awareness training to prevent phishing attacks [13]. This approach leverages AI

algorithms to simulate phishing attacks and train individuals to recognize and respond to such threats.
Integrating AI-based cybersecurity awareness training into educational programs and organizational
practices can enhance individuals' ability to detect and prevent phishing attacks.

## Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity

The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various industries, but it also introduces new cybersecurity
challenges. Research has emphasized the importance of addressing cybersecurity issues in IoT devices
and networks [15]. Detecting and mitigating cybersecurity attacks in IoT systems require the application
of AI methods [15]. Future research should focus on developing effective AI-based solutions for detecting
and preventing cybersecurity attacks in IoT environments.

## Conclusion

The behavioral aspects of cybersecurity play a crucial role in ensuring information security and mitigating
cyber threats. Human errors and lack of knowledge are significant contributors to cybersecurity failures,
highlighting the need for interventions that target internet addiction, impulsivity, and attitudes towards
cybersecurity. Incorporating complexity science and information systems can provide valuable insights
into the dynamics of cyberattacks and inform the development of effective countermeasures. Additionally,
research in the design of secure water treatment systems, fast malware classification, human factors in
cybersecurity, industrial critical infrastructure, AI in cybersecurity, and IoT cybersecurity contributes to
our understanding of the behavioral aspects of cybersecurity. Future research should address knowledge
gaps and explore potential research directions to further advance this field and enhance cybersecurity
practices.
