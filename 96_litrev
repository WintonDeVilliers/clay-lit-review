# Literature Review: Drivers, Barriers, and Social Considerations for AI Adoption in SCM

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including supply chain management (SCM). This literature review aims to explore
the drivers, barriers, and social considerations for AI adoption in SCM. The findings from various studies
will be integrated and synthesized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Drivers for AI Adoption in SCM

Several drivers have been identified for the adoption of AI in SCM. These drivers include increased
efficiency, improved decision-making, and reduced costs.
Increased Efficiency:
One of the primary drivers for AI adoption in SCM is the potential to enhance operational efficiency.
According to Hangl et al. (2023), AI technologies can automate various tasks in supply chain processes,
leading to improved speed and accuracy. AI can assist in demand forecasting, inventory management, and
logistics optimization, thereby streamlining SCM operations and reducing inefficiencies (Sharma et al.,
2022).
Improved Decision-Making:
AI can also contribute to improved decision-making in SCM. By analyzing large volumes of data and
identifying patterns and trends, AI systems can provide valuable insights for decision-makers. This can
help in making informed decisions related to demand planning, supplier selection, and risk management
(Chang et al., 2022). AI-powered predictive analytics can enable proactive decision-making based on
real-time data, leading to more efficient and effective supply chain management (Lee et al., 2019).
Reduced Costs:
Cost reduction is another significant driver for AI adoption in SCM. Through automation and optimization, AI technologies can help reduce operational costs by minimizing errors, optimizing inventory
levels, and improving resource allocation (Dash et al., 2019). AI-powered predictive maintenance can also
prevent costly equipment failures and downtime, leading to cost savings in the supply chain (Lee et al.,
2019).

## Barriers to AI Adoption in SCM

Despite the potential benefits, there are several barriers that hinder the adoption of AI in SCM. These
barriers include data quality and management issues, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and
trust in AI.
Data Quality and Management Issues:
One of the primary barriers to AI adoption in SCM is the quality and management of data. According to
Recht et al. (2020), AI algorithms heavily rely on high-quality and reliable data for accurate predictions
and decision-making. However, SCM data can be complex and heterogeneous, making it challenging to
ensure data quality and consistency (Helo & Hao, 2021). Data integration, data cleansing, and data privacy
concerns are some of the key challenges in managing SCM data for AI applications (Pozzi et al., 2021).
Resistance to Change:
Resistance to change within organizations is another barrier to AI adoption in SCM. Implementing AI
technologies often requires significant organizational changes, including changes in processes, roles, and
responsibilities. Resistance to these changes can arise from employees' fear of job displacement or a
lack of understanding about the benefits of AI (Gutierrez et al., 2018). Overcoming this barrier requires
effective change management strategies, such as clear communication, training, and involving employees
in the AI implementation process (Helo & Hao, 2021).
Lack of Understanding and Trust in AI:
A lack of understanding and trust in AI systems among stakeholders is another barrier to adoption. Many
individuals may have limited knowledge about AI and its potential applications in SCM. Furthermore,
concerns about the reliability, fairness, and ethical implications of AI may undermine trust in AI systems
(Meskó & Topol, 2023). Building trust and promoting AI literacy among stakeholders through education
and transparency can help address this barrier (Xu et al., 2021).

## Social Considerations for AI Adoption in SCM

Apart from the drivers and barriers, there are important social considerations that need to be taken into
account when adopting AI in SCM. These considerations include stakeholder involvement, focus on data
quality and management, and ethical implications.
Stakeholder Involvement:
To ensure successful AI implementation in SCM, it is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders. This
includes employees, suppliers, customers, and regulators. Engaging stakeholders in the decision-making
process and addressing their concerns can foster a sense of ownership and increase the likelihood of
successful AI adoption (Hangl et al., 2023).

Focus on Data Quality and Management:
Given the importance of data quality for AI applications, organizations should prioritize data quality and
management in SCM. This involves ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and consistency, as well as
implementing robust data governance practices (Recht et al., 2020). Organizations should also address
data privacy concerns to maintain trust with stakeholders (Pozzi et al., 2021).
Ethical Implications:
The adoption of AI in SCM raises ethical considerations that need to be carefully addressed. These include
issues related to privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Organizations should establish ethical
guidelines and frameworks for AI adoption to mitigate potential risks and ensure responsible use of AI in
SCM (Meskó & Topol, 2023).

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the existing literature provides valuable insights into the drivers, barriers, and social considerations
for AI adoption in SCM, there are still some knowledge gaps that warrant further research.
One knowledge gap is the specific challenges and recommendations for implementing AI in different
stages of the supply chain, such as procurement, production, and distribution. Future research could
explore the unique drivers, barriers, and social considerations that arise in each stage and provide tailored
recommendations for successful AI adoption.
Another area for future research is the impact of AI adoption on the workforce in SCM. The potential
displacement of jobs due to automation raises important social and economic implications. Understanding
the implications of AI adoption on the workforce, including skill requirements and job transformations,
can help organizations and policymakers navigate this transition effectively.
Additionally, more research is needed to explore the long-term effects of AI adoption on SCM performance. While the drivers and potential benefits of AI adoption are well-documented, empirical studies that
evaluate the actual impact on key performance indicators, such as cost reduction, efficiency improvement,
and customer satisfaction, would provide valuable insights for organizations considering AI implementation.
In conclusion, AI adoption in SCM offers the potential for increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and reduced costs. However, several barriers, including data quality and management issues, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and trust in AI, need to be addressed for successful adoption.
Social considerations, such as stakeholder involvement, data quality focus, and ethical implications, must
also be taken into account. Future research should focus on addressing knowledge gaps and exploring

the specific challenges and recommendations for AI adoption in different stages of the supply chain,
workforce implications, and long-term performance effects.
