# Literature Review: Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain Performance

## Introduction

The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought significant transformations in various industries, including supply
chain management. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits,
challenges, and critical success factors of 11 core technologies related to Industry 4.0 and supply chain
performance. The review integrates and synthesizes findings from multiple research studies to enhance
our understanding of the subject matter.

## Benefits of Industry 4.0 in Supply Chain Management

One of the key benefits of Industry 4.0 in supply chain management is the improvement in risk management capabilities. Ivanov and Dolgui (2020) highlight that the utilization of SC visualization, historical
disruption data analysis, and real-time disruption data can enhance predictive and reactive decisions,
ensuring end-to-end visibility and business continuity in global companies. The study contributes to the
research and practice of SC risk management.
Another benefit of Industry 4.0 in supply chain management is the development of digital supply
chain models. Garay-Rondero et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive overview of the new concepts and
components driving digital supply chains (DSCs). Their model provides insights into the nascent and
current DSCs, thereby addressing the need for a holistic understanding of this emerging field.

## Challenges of Industry 4.0 in Supply Chain Management

While there are several benefits, Industry 4.0 also presents challenges in supply chain management.
Gupta et al. (2020) emphasize the role of institutional pressures in moderating the relationship between
exploration and exploitation orientation and the intentions of adopting Industry 4.0 and digital supply
chain. The analysis indicates that coercive pressure is the primary institutional pressure that affects the
adoption of these technologies.
Hofmann et al. (2019) identify seven basic capabilities and six main enabler technologies that shape the
digital supply chain capabilities (DSCC) framework. This finding suggests that the implementation of
Industry 4.0 technologies requires organizations to develop and enhance specific capabilities and leverage
enabler technologies. These challenges highlight the need for organizations to align their capabilities with
the requirements of Industry 4.0.

## Critical Success Factors of Industry 4.0 in Supply Chain Management

In addition to the benefits and challenges, critical success factors play a crucial role in the effective
implementation of Industry 4.0 in supply chain management. Queiroz et al. (2019) emphasize that
adopting digital supply chain capabilities enables manufacturing companies in Malaysia to remain
competitive by providing good supply chain performance and overall organizational performance. This
finding underscores the importance of developing digital supply chain capabilities to achieve a sustainable
competitive advantage.
The study by Preindl et al. (2020) identifies the potential paths linking Industry 4.0 and sustainable
performance. The findings suggest that transformation strategies for the supply chain, driven by Industry
4.0 and digital transformation, can positively impact sustainable performance. This highlights the need
for organizations to integrate sustainability considerations into their Industry 4.0 initiatives.

## Future Research Directions

Despite the growing body of literature on Industry 4.0 and supply chain performance, there are still
several knowledge gaps that warrant further research. Firstly, future studies can explore the specific
mechanisms through which SC visualization, historical disruption data analysis, and real-time disruption
data contribute to improved risk management in global companies (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020).
Secondly, there is a need for more research on the institutional pressures that shape the adoption of
Industry 4.0 and digital supply chain. Gupta et al. (2020) highlight the role of coercive pressure, but there
may be other institutional factors that influence organizations' intentions to adopt these technologies.
Furthermore, future research can delve deeper into the specific capabilities and enabler technologies that
drive the development of digital supply chain capabilities (Hofmann et al., 2019). Understanding the
mechanisms through which these capabilities and technologies interact can provide valuable insights for
organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives.
Lastly, there is a need for more research on the link between Industry 4.0 and sustainable performance.
Preindl et al. (2020) highlight the potential paths linking these two constructs, but further studies can explore the specific strategies and practices that organizations can adopt to achieve sustainable performance
through Industry 4.0 implementation.
In conclusion, this literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits, challenges, and
critical success factors of Industry 4.0 in supply chain management. The integration and synthesis of the
provided research findings enhance our understanding of the subject matter. However, there are several
knowledge gaps that require further research to advance our knowledge in this field.
