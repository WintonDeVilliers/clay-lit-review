ABSTRACT
Hackers follow a standard cyber kill chain process and install ransomware payloads using phishing emails on
firms belonging to critical industry, resulting in huge losses in revenue, reputation, and customer churn. This
study uses a mixed-method explanatory approach to mitigate ransomware attacks. We present the quantitative
Ransomware Risk Management Model (R2M2) based on protection motivation theory (PMT). The Ransomware
Risk Assessment module based on the threat appraisal component of PMT and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) guidelines can help the chief information security officer (CISO) to assess the risk using
predictive analytics techniques. The Ransomware Risk Quantification module uses collective risk modeling to
compute the severity of a ransomware attack on an organization. The Ransomware Risk Mitigation module helps
the CISO to minimize the probability and impact of a ransomware attack on their organization by (i) investing in
perimeter security technologies and training to ensure prepare, deter, detect, restrain, recover, and review
mitigation strategies, (ii) adopting the National Institue of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
Framework to ensure business resilience, and (iii) mitigating the residual risk by investing in cyber-risk insurance. We validated the proposed method using a qualitative study by interviewing participants form firms
affected by ransomware, managed security service providers, security consultants, and cyber-risk insurers.
1. Introduction
Ransomware is an advanced persistent threat (APT) that stealthily
attacks the information system of an organization operating in the
critical sector. This malware tends to encrypt essential files (cryptographic ransomware) and/or lockout users from the system (locker ransomware). As a result, the organization’s operational activities come to a
standstill, adversely affecting its revenue and reputation. These attackers demand high ransoms of cryptocurrencies (Laszka et al., 2017;
Oz et al., 2022). Between 2019 and 2021, the number of ransomware
attacks worldwide increased from 200 to 600. This upward trend is
predicted to continue as hackers use more hybrid encryption algorithms
and request ransom payments through cryptocurrencies (Oz et al.,
2022). Between 2019 and 2021, the overall loss of revenue due to ransomware attacks increased from US$11.5 billion to US$20 billion.
Consequently, the projected losses from ransomware attacks are anticipated to reach US$265 billion by 2031.
On November 23, 2022, a ransomware attack encrypted the data of
the healthcare information system at the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and a ransom of US$24.5 million was
demanded. The healthcare delivery system at AIIMS came to a grinding
halt for a week, which caused immense distress to patients and doctors.
Similarly, a ransomware attack on May 31, 2022, exfiltrated the data
from the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica and US$15 million was
demanded to restore the stolen information. Following this attack, the
Costa Rican government declared a national emergency and suspended
online government services.
Given these circumstances, the chief information security officer
(CISO) of an organization should first conduct a detailed vulnerability
assessment and then gather threat intelligence regarding the probable
attack surfaces in the IT environment and attack vectors that a hacker
may use as part of the cyber kill chain (CKC) (Lockheed, 2011) to launch
a ransomware attack. Accordingly, the CISO must estimate the likelihood of a ransomware attack and its associated impact on the firm’s
operations. The CISO uses a heat matrix to visualize the above probability and impact and prioritizes mitigation strategies based on the NIST
guidelines (NIST, 2018, 2022). Within this context, this study aims to
use a mixed-method explanatory approach (Ballerini, Herhausen, &

Ferraris, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2021; Kar & Dwivedi, 2020; Maier et al.,
2023; Mikalef et al., 2019; Wunderlich et al., 2019) to examine the
following research questions:
RQ1). What is the probability of correctly identifying a ransomware
attack?
RQ2). What are the expected financial losses to a business from a
ransomware attack?
RQ3). What are the means of mitigating (i.e., preventing, deterring,
detecting, restraining, recovering, and reviewing) the effects of ransomware attacks by investment in technology and cyber-risk insurance?
This study contributes to the extant literature by proposing the
comprehensive Ransomware Risk Management Model (R2M2) that assesses, quantifies, and mitigates ransomware risk based on the concepts
of threat appraisal and coping appraisal in protection motivation theory
(PMT) (Boss et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019; Ou et al., 2022; Rogers, 1975a;
Yoo et al., 2020). The model comprises of three modules: Ransomware
Risk Assessment (RRA), Ransomware Risk Quantification (RRQ), and
Ransomware Risk Mitigation (RRM). The RRA module, which is based
on the threat appraisal concept of PMT (Boss et al., 2015), helps the
CISO to assess the risk of a ransomware attack on the organization,
considering (i) the organizational structure, (ii) technological factors,
(iii) environmental vulnerability, and (iv) information security governance. Hypotheses are tested using generalized linear models such as
logistic regression (LR) (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019; Son et al., 2020).
Thethe RRA module uses predictive analytics techniques, namely L,
naïve Bayes (NB), and decision tree (DT), to assess the ransomware risk.
LR outperforms the other classifiers in terms of assessing the likelihood
of ransomware attacks. Thereafter, the RRQ module computes the expected severity of a ransomware attack based on the likelihood and
impact of the cyber risk (Biswas et al., 2023, Biswas et al., 2022; Hossack
et al., 1983; Sharma and Mukhopadhyay, 2023). Finally, the RRM
module helps the CISO to visualize the cyber risk of an organization on a
heat matrix. This module is based on rational choice theory (RCT)
(Becker, 1990; Boss et al., 2015; McCarthy, 2002), Kleindorfer & Kunreuther (1999)) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST, 2014b,
2018) and helps to prioritize mitigation strategies for the CISO in terms
of the proportion of cyber risks to be accepted, reduced, or transferred.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A literature review on ransomware risk assessment, quantification, and mitigation is
provided in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the research model and the
corresponding hypotheses. Section 4 describes the quantitative assessment while Section 5 states the qualitative study. Section 6 discusses the
results of the study and their implications for academia and industry.
Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
2. Literature review
Organizations that belong to critical industries, such as healthcare,
oil, and gas are prone to ransomware attacks, which lead to data exfiltration and locking of computer systems. According to risk (Kleindorfer
& Kunreuther, 1999; Kunreuther, 1997; Kunreuther & Heal, 2003) and
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST, 2018), the CISO of such organizations needs to carry out regular risk assessments and quantification of the vulnerabilities in IT resources that can be exploited to
generate a possible cyberattack on the organization (Jain & Mukhopadhyay, 2023). These CISOs must understand the attacker’s behavior
using a CKC (Lockheed, 2011) and quantify the expected loss that can
occur due to downtime or reputational loss accordingly. Furthermore, as
per PMT (Boss et al., 2015; Rogers, 1975b) and RCT (Boss et al., 2015),
the CISO, who is a rational actor based on the risk-profile of the organization, strategizes the cyber-risk mitigation policy (transfer, accept, or
reduce). Therefore, we divide our literature review into three sections:
ransomware risk assessment, ransomware risk quantification, and ransomware risk mitigation. The first subsection provides a review of the
antecedents that have been considered in previous studies to determine
the likelihood of data breaches caused by ransomware. The following
subsection discusses methods used to quantify the risk of ransomware
attacks. The final subsection reviews the strategies adopted to mitigate
ransomware risks.
2.1. Ransomware risk assessment (RRA)
Ransomware can effectively compromise the IT defense of an organization and encrypt important files to prevent its operations. Previous
studies on ransomware have primarily focused on the identification and
detection of malware using technical features such as dynamic link libraries, registry keys, file processes, and payloads (Connolly & Wall,
2019; Yuryna Connolly et al., 2020). Static (Baldwin & Dehghantanha,
2018; pp. 107–136; Zuhair et al., 2020; pp, 1009, 3210) and dynamic
(Cohen & Nissim, 2018; Ramesh & Menen, 2020) analyses have been
performed to detect ransomware attacks. Static analysis entails identifying ransomware by extracting structural inputs, such as file information or malware opcodes, instead of executing (Oz et al., 2022). In
contrast, dynamic analysis involves executing a sample and examining
its behavioral characteristics, such as host logs, I/O access, or network
activity, to identify the ransomware (Oz et al., 2022). However, very few
studies have considered factors other than the characteristics of ransomware binaries. The study of socio-technical factors is essential for
understanding why any organization falls victim to such attacks
(Samonas et al., 2020). Ransomwares are growing into targeted attacks
(Stolk, 2022), which highlights the importance of adopting a
socio-technological approach. Considering this gap in the research, this
study investigates factors that have been explored in a limited number of
studies concerning ransomware as well as those that are used in
assessing the risk of data breaches in general. The following subsections
provide a literature review of the likelihood of ransomware attacks
based on (i) the organizational structure, (ii) technological factors, (iii)
vulnerability assessment, and (iv) information security governance
(Angst et al., 2017; Boss et al., 2015; Weixun Li et al., 2023).
2.1.1. Organizational structure
The size of an organization plays an important role in its organizational structure (Arad et al., 1997), Management Information System
success (Raymond, 1985), computer use (DeLone, 1981), investment in
internal or external IT resources (Ein-Dor & Segev, 1978), the symbolic
or substantive adoption of cybersecurity measures (Angst et al., 2017),
and the severity of ransomware attacks (Yuryna Connolly et al., 2020),
among others. The levels of "risk tolerance" and "regulatory requirements" (Samonas et al., 2020; Tsen et al., 2022) vary depending on
the sector (healthcare, financial, education, public administration and
defense, manufacturing, etc.) to which a firm belongs (ARAD et al.,
1997). Large organizations in critical industries are prone to ransomware attacks because they can adversely impact the economy of a
country.
2.1.2. Technological factors
Researchers have identified digital intensity as a significant technological factor that determines the occurrence of data breaches
(Schlackl et al., 2022). Digital intensity refers to the extent of digital
technology usage across different levels of operational and strategic
activities within an organization (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Chanias et al.,
2019). Kim and Kwon (2019) found that as the use of electronic health
records increases in hospitals, the risk of cyberattacks also increases.
This observation was also noted by McLeod and Dolezel (2018), who
assessed the level of exposure of a healthcare firm by implementing
Computerized Physician Order Entry systems. Another study reported
that the odds of facing ransomware attacks also increases with higher
digital intensity (Smith et al., 2021). However, if such organizations also
tend to have trained CISOs to ensure compliance with governance, their
probability of facing ransomware attacks is reduced. Moreover, if the IT

network is well segregated, the chances and impact of a data breach are
reduced (Shu et al., 2017). Even if an attacker gains unauthorized access, network segmentation prevents the further spread of the breach
(Conti et al., 2018). It appears that few studies have investigated the
impact of digital intensity and network segmentation on the occurrence
of ransomware attacks.
2.1.3. Vulnerability assessment
According to NIST (2014a), the computing environment of a firm
encompasses its IT architecture and organizational features. Potential
vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and networks can increase or
decrease depending on the environment in which they exist (FIRST,
2019). Therefore, previous studies have suggested that vulnerability
assessment is a critical factor to consider (Schlackl et al., 2022) in
determining the risk of a ransomware attack.
2.1.4. Information security governance
Information security governance refers to the centralized deployment of information security across an organization, considering the
technical, process, and human perspectives (Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, the COBIT19 and ITIL frameworks provide effective guidance
for organizations regarding the implementation of security in their IT
infrastructure by following IT security governance principles (COBIT,
2007; Meijer et al., 2013). These frameworks recommend implementing
IT controls to reduce risk and enhance the resilience of a firm. The level
of resilience in the environment determines the extent to which a firm is
exposed to a cyberattack (Schlackl et al., 2022). However, previous
studies have not considered the organizational structure, technology,
vulnerabilities, and information security governance together to assess
the risk of ransomware attacks.
2.2. Ransomware risk quantification (RRQ)
The literature includes several studies that have quantified the losses
arising from ransomware attacks. Ochoa et al. (2021) proposed a model
that considers the probability of a ransomware attack (p) occurring as an
input to express the impact of a ransomware attack in monetary terms.
McIntosh et al. (2022) stated that the losses incurred by ransomware
attacks are based on the type and duration of the attack, the cyber
resilience of the organization, and preparedness against the attack. Few
studies have quantified the risk of ransomware (R) attacks. Therefore,
weextend our study to non-ransomware (NR) cyberattacks, such as
denial-of-service (DoS), system penetration, and unauthorized access, in
critical sectors such as finance, consultancy, education, IT, and healthcare organizations, to understand the methods used to quantify losses.
Biswas et al. (2022), Sharma and Mukhopadhyay (2022), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2019), and Das et al. (2019) used various predictive
analysis techniques (both structured and unstructured) to quantify
cyberattack losses. Table 1 summarizes the techniques used to quantify
losses caused by cyberattacks by firms across various industries.
Considering the risk quantification methodologies for diverse attack
types in various sectors, this study concludes that the expected loss is the
product of the probability of a ransomware attack multiplied by the loss
it incurs.
2.3. Ransomware risk mitigation (RRM)
The aftermath of ransomware attacks has motivated authors to
explore mitigation measures (McIntosh et al., 2022). The following
subsections outline mitigation methods in terms of the movement of a
ransomware attacker along the line of the CKC. A cybersecurity team can
check the timeline of events to understand the current state of attack,
damage, and severity and respond accordingly to stop or minimize
further damage (CISA, 2022).
2.3.1. CKC pre-exploit phases (reconnaissance, weaponization, and
delivery)
Previous studies have suggested that it is best to stop a ransomware
attack during the reconnaissance and weaponization phases of the CKC
to neutralize the attacker (Akbanov et al., 2019; Al-Rimy et al., 2018;
Brewer, 2016; Harrison et al., 2022; McIntosh et al., 2022). A ransomware attacker attempts to reconnoiter the IT assets to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited (Muckin & Fitch, 2019). The CISO should
know the organizational environment (NIST, 2022) using a vulnerability
scan to identify the weak links in hardware or software and the external
connections of information flow that serve as entry points for ransomware attackers (Ramesh & Menen, 2020). The initial vulnerability
assessment and subsequent patching will help to deter attackers
(Ramesh & Menen, 2020). Building defensive boundaries shields the
organization from the sights of the attacker and establishes security
controls (NIST, 2022). It is always preferable to encrypt information so
that it becomes difficult for an attacker to understand (Brewer, 2016).
However, if the attacker successfully moves to the next stage of ransomware delivery, training employees not to click links in phishing
emails or content filtering will help to identify and block the delivery (Li
et al., 2019; Souppaya & Scarfone, 2013; Wong et al., 2022). Backups
further help to restore data if a ransomware attack occurs (Muhly et al.,
2022).
2.3.2. CKC exploit and post-exploit phases (exploitation, installation, C&C,
and actions)
After successful delivery of the payload, the attacker attempts to
exploit the vulnerabilities to move laterally inside the network of the
victim and remain undetected. This infiltration can be stopped by an
intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS),
antivirus, or next-generation firewall (Harrison et al., 2022; IBM Security, 2022; Ramesh & Menen, 2020). In the next stage, the intruder attempts to install the ransomware and establish contact with the
command & control (C&C) to conduct a ransomware attack. At this
point, the security information and event management (SIEM) technologies will help to monitor the IT systems for ransomware binaries and
generate alarms to awaken the cybersecurity team (IBM, 2022). Finally,
the attacker attempts to encrypt or exfiltrate the victim’s information or
lock the victim’s machine. At this point, the mitigation strategy should
be avoiding further spreading of the attack (Souppaya & Scarfone,
2013). This can be achieved by disconnecting compromised systems
from the infected network, temporarily stopping the use of the infected

application, and suspending internet access (IBM Security, 2022; NIST,
2022). Sandboxing or virtualization of applications or operating systems
can also help stop the spread (CISA, 2022). Employees, clients, and
vendors should be informed about the ransomware attack (Akbanov
et al., 2019; Souppaya & Scarfone, 2013; Young, 2021). Later, business
operations can be resumed with backed-up data (Baek et al., 2021; Chen
et al., 2021; NIST, 2022; Straub & Welke, 1998). The systems or services
that have been temporarily suspended because of ransomware infection
can be restored (Muhly et al., 2022; Thakur et al., 2021). Most importantly, learning from the incident should be inculcated in the overall
process of ransomware risk management, such as updating deterrence
mechanisms (Baek et al., 2021; NIST, 2022). Prior research has suggested that organizations should quickly manage lost reputations or
business relations (Muhly et al., 2022; NIST, 2022). Table 2 summarizes
the ransomware attack mitigation methods proposed by previous
researchers.
3. Research design
We adopted a mixed-method approach to explore the above research
questions. This explanatory approach seeks answers to research questions through quantitative data (Ballerini et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al.,
2021; Kar & Dwivedi, 2020; Maier et al., 2023; Mikalef et al., 2019;
Wunderlich et al., 2019). The quantitative study considered the significant factors behind ransomware attack risk, guided by previous literature. Subsequently, we conducted a qualitative study using
semi-structured interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the findings of the quantitative study. In the qualitative study, we focused on
organizations that had experienced cyberattacks, as well as firms and
consultants that provided the organizations with technological solutions
and cyber-risk insurers. The perspectives and opinions of experts at
different levels helped us to understand the dynamics behind why
certain factors play a key role in determining the ransomware attack risk
in a firm.
4. Quantitative study
4.1. Hypothesis development
The proposed R2M2 is based on PMT, which consists of two components: threat appraisal (TA) and coping appraisal (CA) (Boss et al.,
2015; Li et al., 2019; Rogers, 1975a). We assume that the CISO of an
organization is risk averse and such an individual will exhibit higher
vigilance, appraise potential threats, and cope with the cyberattack
situation (Kahane et al., 1988; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). Based on
the TA component of PMT and the NIST guidelines, the RR module helps
a CISO to assess the risk based on sociotechnical factors. These factors
are considered because the risk of a ransomware attack does not depend
solely on the technology that is implemented within an organization. It
is also influenced by the culture, governance, and training provided to
the employees of an organization (Wong et al., 2022). Next, the RRQ
module computes the severity of a ransomware attack (R) on the organization (NIST, 2014b).
Similarly, based on the CA component of PMT, as well as RCT
(Becker, 1990; Boss et al., 2015; McCarthy, 2002), trade-off theory
(Campbell & Kelly, 1994), and conservation of resources (COR) theory
(Hobfoll et al., 2000), the RRM module helps the CISO to minimize the
probability and impact of the ransomware attack on their organization
by (i) investing in perimeter security technologies (such as firewalls,
IDSs, and antivirus) and training to ensure prepare, deter, detect,
restrain, recover, and review (PDDRRR) mitigation strategies, (ii)
adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to ensure business resilience, and (iii) mitigating the residual risk by investing in cyber-risk
insurance products (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013). Fig. 1 depicts the
proposed R2M2 model.
Table 3 summarizes the constructs used in the R2M2 model and their
support in the literature.
4.1.1. RRA
4.1.1.1. Organizational structure. According to the CKC model shown in
Fig. 2 (NIST, 2014b), an attacker initially carries out reconnaissance to
assess the potential benefits in terms of ransom (Oz et al., 2022) that
they could gain from targeting an organization (NIST, 2022; Souppaya &
Scarfone, 2013). Larger organizations, although better equipped with
security technologies (Angst et al., 2017; Dalton et al., 1980; McLeod &
Dolezel, 2018; Schlackl et al., 2022), would be severely impacted by a
ransomware attack, as their IT-enabled supply chain may come to a
standstill. To maintain seamless operations, a large organization will
prefer to pay the ransom at times (Carroll & Stater, 2008). Therefore,
this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H1a. : Larger organizations are more prone to ransomware attacks.
Firms in critical sectors (healthcare, finance, or public administration) ensure the security, integrity, and resilience of their operations by
complying with strict regulatory guidelines (Jain, Mukhopadhyay &

Jain, 2023; Samonas et al., 2020) for data protection, privacy, incident
response, and contingency planning (Tripathi and Mukhopadhyay,
2022; Ballerini et al., 2023; Patel, Graham, & Ralston, 2008). This ensures operational continuity and maintains public trust and confidence
in the ability of the firm to safeguard critical infrastructure and sensitive
information (Samonas et al., 2020; Tsen et al., 2022). As indicated in
Fig. 2, smart attackers choose to deliver weaponized APT tools such as
ransomware to the servers of these firms to exfiltrate or encrypt sensitive
data, disrupt essential services, and endanger the safety of citizens
(ARAD et al., 1997). If these firms in critical sectors are impacted, the
entire economy of a country may come to a grinding halt. Therefore,
hackers have a greater chance of extracting ransoms from these firms.
Thus, we hypothesize the following:
H1b. : Organizations belonging to critical industries are more prone to
ransomware attacks.
4.1.1.2. Technological factors. Digital intensity indicates the degree of
digitalization within a firm (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Chanias et al.,
2019). If an organization uses e-commerce as an important channel for
revenue generation, customers and suppliers can use the internet to
access customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain
management software. As shown in Fig. 2, a hacker can masquerade as a
legitimate user and drop potential ransomware malware (Connolly &

Wall, 2019). For example, a hospital that allows online patient booking
facilities would come to a standstill if the ransomware locks its CRM or
encrypts its database and demands a ransom in exchange (Al-Rimy et al.,
2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Hence, we hypothesize the following:
H2a. Higher digital intensity leads to an increased probability of
ransomware attacks.
As shown in Fig. 2, after the successful delivery of the payload in the
digital systems, a hacker will remotely attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities and communicate the same to the C&C center (FIRST, 2019;
McIntosh et al., 2022). A CISO (i) compartmentalizes the larger network
into a smaller virtual LAN, (ii) separates critical applications or servers
from the internet, and (iii) restricts the movement of the ransomware
from a compromised system to an uninfected critical system (Conti et al.,
2018; Mos & Chowdhury, 2020). Sandboxing or virtualization of applications or operating systems also helps to stop the spread of ransomware (CISA, 2022). Hence, we hypothesize the following:
H2b. The segmentation of the IT network will block ransomware
attacks.
4.1.1.3. Vulnerability assessment. As shown in Fig. 2, an external hacker
exploits the vulnerabilities (Schlackl et al., 2022) in a digital platform by
resorting to attack vectors such as social engineering to carry out a
confidence–integrity–availability (CIA) breach (FIRST, 2019; Zhuang
et al., 2020). For instance, a hacker can trick a customer into clicking on
a phishing email that can exploit vulnerabilities in the CRM software of a
firm. The hacker intends to misuse the privilege of customers and employees (PR) (O’Kane et al., 2018; Oz et al., 2022). Once a hacker obtains
access to the CRM system, it delivers the payload to the target software
or network. In most cases, the hacker does so without engaging the user
(UI) and without changing the authorization rights (scope (SC)) of the
vulnerable client portal or business rules, which in turn brings the
supply chain management of the digital platform to a standstill, resulting in a huge loss of revenue, reputation, and customer churn
(Almashhadani et al., 2019; Dargahi et al., 2019; Lockheed, 2011).
Hence, the literature suggests that the CISO should know their organizational environment (NIST, 2022) well before the adversary does.
Using the concepts of threat intelligence and the CKC (Lockheed, 2011),
the CISO of an organization can reduce the vulnerability in the organization’s environment. For instance, an organization that sets privileges
as more restrictive (PR) is less exposed to the risk of a ransomware attack
(Peters, 2017). FIRST (2019) defined the vulnerability score, which is
platform and vendor agnostic, and considered the environmental conditions that increase and decrease the impact of such vulnerabilities on
an organization. Based on this understanding, we hypothesize the
following:
H3: Organizations with high environmental vulnerability scores are
more likely to encounter ransomware attacks.
4.1.1.4. Information security governance. According to the coping
appraisal component of PMT (Boss et al., 2015; Rogers, 1975a), the top
leadership of an organization will attempt to reduce the likelihood of
ransomware attacks. To achieve this, they implement an information
security governance framework that is aligned with the strategic goals of
the organization (Fazlida & Said, 2015; Weixun Li et al., 2023). This
implementation incorporates cybersecurity controls and measures that
are aimed at reducing the environmental vulnerability score (Schlackl
et al., 2022) and, consequently, the probability of a ransomware attack
(Bodeau et al., 2010; Bowen & Wilson, 2006). Therefore, we hypothesize
the following:
H4. : Organizations that have implemented information security
governance are less likely to experience ransomware attacks.
4.1.1.5. Likelihood of a ransomware attack. An intruder can install
ransomware and threaten to exfiltrate or encrypt the information that is
stored in the IT assets (Muckin & Fitch, 2019). The hacker claims a
ransom in return for restoring the operations of the IT assets. As shown
in Fig. 2, the CISO uses historical data from endpoint detection and
response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR), and SIEM to
create a model for classifying the likelihood of a ransomware attack on a
firm. Previous studies have noted that cyberattacks tend to follow a
Weibull distribution (Hossack et al., 1983). This is because a small
number of cyberattacks occur frequently. For example, DDoS attacks
that send packets of moderate sizes to clog the network, are large in
number, but large-sized packets causing DDoS attacks will be lower in
number. Furthermore, the flexibility of the Weibull distribution allows it
to accommodate various shapes, making it adaptable to a wide range of
cyberattack scenarios (Wang et al., 2015). By adjusting the shape
parameter, it is possible to model various characteristics of different
cyberattack situations. The scale parameter corresponds to the position
of the Weibull curve relative to the threshold, similar to how the mean
influences the position of a normal curve (Hossack et al., 1983). Hence,
we hypothesize the following:

H5a. : The probability of occurrence of ransomware and nonransomware attacks on an organization tends to follow a Weibull
distribution.
4.1.2. RRQ
If the operations of an organization belonging to a critical industry
(healthcare, financial services, or supply chain) are stalled, this leads to
immense monetary losses (Biswas et al., 2022). The RRQ module considers such losses (L), along with the risk probability (p) computed in the
RRA module, to calculate the severity of the attack in terms of the
estimated losses (EL). The losses arising from cyberattacks follow a
long-tail gamma distribution (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019; Dutta &
Perry, 2006). It is noted that losses due to ransomware generally tend to
be low in magnitude, but some, such as WannaCry, which impacted the
National Health Services (NHS) and spread very quickly across the
globe, had a high impact of US$4 billion globally (Hossack et al., 1983;
Wang et al., 2015). Hence, we hypothesize the following:
H5b. : The expected losses arising from ransomware and nonransomware attacks follow a gamma distribution.
4.1.3. RRM
Finally, the RRM module provides recommendations for mitigating
the losses resulting from a ransomware attack on an organization. According to the CA of PMT theory, the CISO of a firm responds to fear
appeals of cyber threats by taking appropriate mitigating actions (Boss
et al., 2015). The RRM module assists the CISO in determining whether
to absorb, transfer, or reduce the cyber risk resulting from the ransomware attack. The model uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST,
2018) and the mitigation strategies suggested by Straub and Welke
(1998) to guide the decision-making process. These methods are divided
into the six phases of PDDRRR, as shown in Table 4. The prepare and
deter phases cover the pre-exploitation activities. The detect, restrain,
recover, and post-incident review phases include the post-exploitation
mitigation methods.
Initially, the CISO should prepare the organization against
ransomware attacks by identifying the most critical inventory of the IT
assets, their internal and external connections, and the information flow
route to neutralize the CKC. Employees should be trained to identify and
prevent attacks by recognizing phishing emails and avoiding clicking
unknown links. Data encryption and remote backups are important for
protection and recovery in later stages. Frequent dry runs of incident
responses are conducted to develop alertness and awareness among
employees and other stakeholders to combat ransomware attacks.
Following preparation, the CISO should attempt to detect ransomware
attacks by ensuring perimeter security using antivirus, IDSs/IPSs, and
new-generation firewalls and by performing vulnerability assessment
and penetration testing to analyze IT assets or network vulnerabilities.
Even with a robust deterrence mechanism, if the ransomware enters
an IT system, detection methodologies are crucial for quickly detecting
and stopping it. Regular monitoring of the system, ensuring cyberhygiene (Wong et al., 2022), detecting unidentified ransomware,
raising alerts, and blocking payload or C&C communications are
important steps. If an attack cannot be stopped, the CISO should focus on
restraining it and preventing its further spread. This involves quarantining infected files or systems, disabling infected services, and

suspending internet connectivity. Additionally, leveraging threat intelligence mechanisms can help to mitigate the impact by analyzing the
attack and anticipating the next move of the attacker. Effective
communication and coordination among all stakeholders is required to
beat attackers. If a firm faces losses, it should immediately seek to
implement a business continuity plan (BCP) or disaster recovery (DR)
plan, which is specifically designed for such contingencies, to recover
from the losses. An infected system can be restored using backed-up data
to ensure minimal disruption to business operations. Following an
incident, it is important to conduct a post-incident analysis to identify
shortcomings in the incident response plan. All phases of the ransomware risk mitigation strategy should be reviewed and updated as
necessary. Additionally, the CISO should seek to compensate for lost
reputation and public relations.
However, it is important to note that organizations face constraints
in terms of time, money, and resources, as suggested by the COR theory
(Gordon et al., 2003a). The decision of investments in different PDDRRR
phases may vary depending on the risk-severity quadrant on the heat
matrix to which the organization belongs, which is in line with the
trade-off theory. For instance, organizations that face ransomware attacks (Q1) should invest a high proportion in deterrence activities with a
low proportion in detection or restraint activities. Therefore, the model
advises the CISO on the level of importance – high (H), medium (M), or
low (L) – to be assigned to mitigation methods (PDDRRR), based on the
location of the organization in the heat matrix (risk × severity).
The CISO of organizations in Q1 should focus on all aspects of the
PDDRRR mitigation strategies to reduce the probability and severity of
ransomware attacks. This is because cyber-insurance firms are unwilling
to provide such organizations coverage against ransomware attacks
(Muhly et al., 2022; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013). Hence, we hypothesize
the following:
H6a. : If an organization faces a high probability and high severity of a
ransomware attack, the CISO tends to prioritize investments in cybersecurity technologies for PDDRRR.
When an organization in the Q2 quadrant of the heat matrix
experiences a low probability of a ransomware attack, the CISO can
focus less on the prepare and detection phases and more on the
remaining PDDRRR phases. The CISO should devise an effective BCP
and DR policy to restore the information systems and ensure business
continuity. This will help to reduce the severity of ransomware attacks
and, consequently, the firm will move from Q2 to Q3 in the heat matrix.
Hence, we hypothesize the following:
H6b. : If an organization faces a low probability but high severity of a
ransomware attack, the CISO tends to prioritize more security technology investment in the detect, restrain, recover, and review activities
than the prevent and deter activities against the attack.
If a firm is in quadrant Q3, cyber insurers will not hesitate to provide
cyber insurance. Hence, such organizations can invest in cyberinsurance policies to protect themselves against future losses from ransomware attacks. As the CISO has transferred the risk to cyber insurers,
the focus on the PDDRRR will automatically be reduced. Hence, we
hypothesize the following:
H6c. : If an organization faces a low probability and low severity of a
ransomware attack, the CISO tends to invest more in cyber insurance
than in PDDRRR mitigation strategies.
Organizations in quadrant Q4, where the probability of an attack is
high but the severity of the attack is low, should focus more on the
prepare and deter stages and can moderately focus on other PDDRRR
stages. The CISOs of such firms should initially resort to self-insurance
and inculcate technology interventions such as firewalls, antivirus,
and IDPs/IPSs to build defensive architectures. Such measures will help
to reduce the probability of ransomware attacks and, consequently,
move the firm from Q4 to Q3. Hence, we propose the following
hypothesis:
H6d. : If an organization faces a high probability but low severity of a
ransomware attack, the CISO tends to prioritize more security technology investment in the prevent and deter activities than the detect,
restrain, recover, and review activities against the attack.

4.2. Methodology and data
This study used data from the University of Queensland, Australia, to
explore the cyber resilience of organizations (Tsen et al., 2020). The
dataset consisted of various features of 1473 organizations belonging to
the critical and non-critical sectors in Australia, the USA, Canada, and
Japan and their associated breaches due to ransomware attacks from
2004 to 2022. The dataset included firms with varying digital intensity,
organizational size, network segmentation, EVSS, and CSR. We referred
to Statista for data on the average financial losses (Lj) (Statista, 2022)
from 2004 to 2022, which are derived from cyber-crime cases reported
by the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which is a part of the FBI.
Table 5 summarizes the statistics of the data.
Table 6 shows the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
4.2.1. RRA
Previous researchers have commonly used the following algorithms to
detect ransomware: the support vector machine (Baldwin & Dehghantanha, 2018, pp. 107–136), random forest (Cohen & Nissim, 2018;
Zhang et al., 2019), DT (Zhang et al., 2019; Zuhair et al., 2020; pp, 1009,
3210), NB (Cohen & Nissim, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zuhair et al., 2020;
pp, 1009, 3210), and LR (Cohen & Nissim, 2018). Table 7 summarizes the
various static and dynamic features that are considered to detect ransomware using different rule-based and machine-learning-based
methods.
We initially tested the hypotheses using generalized linear models,
such as LR in module M1, as shown in Eq. (1) (Agresti, 2002; McCullagh
& Nelder, 1989; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019; Son et al., 2020).
M1(LR) : P(C = Ransomware, Non-Ransomware) = 1
(1 + exp − Z )
... (1)
Z = β0 + β1*CI + β2*Size + β3*DI + β4*NS + β5*EVS + β6*CSR
Next, in our RRA module, we used predictive analytics techniques
such as LR, NB, and DT in modules M1, M2, and M3, respectively, to
assess the likelihood of ransomware attacks versus non-ransomware
attacks. M1 uses LR, which is a special case of the generalized linear
model that provides the probability of occurrence of each binary class
(Son et al., 2020). LR is one of the most renowned and extensively
employed predictive models in the literature (Bardhan et al., 2015;
Ben-Assuli & Padman, 2020). The second classifier, M2, uses the NB
classification technique to estimate the probability (p) of a ransomware
attack. The NB classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’
theorem that assumes that the variables are independent of one another
(Han et al., 2012). Finally, M3 uses the DT classification technique to
generate rules to classify R and NR and to estimate the probability (p).
The NB classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem
that assumes that the variables are independent of one another. Similar
to the NB algorithm, the DT algorithm is a supervised learning technique
that is used to perform predictions (Ben-Assuli & Padman, 2020; Yahav
et al., 2016). Previous studies have predicted the readmissions of patients with chronic diseases (Ben-Assuli & Padman, 2020), financial
fraud (Abbasi et al., 2012) and false news on social media (Wei et al.,
2022),
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets at a ratio of
70:30. The LR, NB, and DT classifiers were initially trained and then
evaluated using the test dataset. A predictive model is gauged according
to its performance on data instances that have not been encountered
before and are found within a designated test dataset (Bardhan et al.,
2015). The performance of the model was evaluated by computing the
accuracy, F-score, precision and recall. This study assessed the risk and
obtained the consequent posterior probabilities (pi) of an attack being R
or NR.
4.2.2. RRQ
We calculate the severity of a ransomware attack by computing the
expected losses (ELi) (Biswas et al., 2022). The mathematical representation of the expected financial loss (ELi), as shown in Eq. (2), is.
ELi = qi * Lj (2)
where qi = misclassification rate = 1 - pi; pi = posterior probabilities; Lj
= losses in each year from 2004 to 2022; ELi = estimated loss for each
organization; and i = organization in the dataset.
4.2.3. RRM
Based on the likelihood of a ransomware attack and its severity, the
RRM module creates a 2 × 2 (risk (q) × severity (EL)) heat matrix. Each
data point is placed in one of the four quadrants (high-high, low-high,
low-low, and high-low) of the heat matrix. This can help the CISO of
an organization to decide whether to absorb, transfer, or reduce the
cyber risk (Baskerville et al., 2008) related to a ransomware attack. The
RRM module guides the CISO in prioritizing the proportion of investment in PDDRRR mitigation strategies based on a threshold of risk (qi)
and severity (ELi). Each test data point is plotted on the heat matrix.
4.3. Results
This section describes the quantitative results obtained from the
RRA, RRQ, and RRM experiments. Section 4.3.1 describes the likelihood
of a ransomware attack, Section 4.3.2 presents the expected losses due to
ransomware attack, and Section 4.3.3 explains the placement of the
organizations on a heat matrix of risk and severity, with mitigation plans
proposed accordingly.
4.3.1. RRA
We used generalized linear models such as LR (Son et al., 2020) in
the RRA module to test the hypotheses. Based on the chi-squared test,
the goodness of fit of the model was revealed to be significant
(p < 0.001) with a small deviance of 66.68. Table 8 reports the parameters of the M1 (LR) model that were significant at the 1% level.
Substituting the values from Table 8 into Equation (1), Eq. (3) is
determined, as follows:

Table 8 and Eq. (3) indicate that larger organizations are 6.786 times
more likely to face R attacks than NR attacks (p = 0.001), thereby
supporting hypothesis H1a. Moreover, if organizations belong to a
critical industry, their chances of facing ransomware attacks increase by
5.229 times compared to NR attacks (p = 0.001). This finding supports
hypothesis H1b. Similarly, for each unit increase in digital intensity, the
odds of R attacks are 13.573 times greater than those of NR attacks
(p = 0.001). This result aligns with hypothesis H2a. However, if the
network is segmented, the probability of occurrence of R attacks decreases to 0.042 times that of NR attacks (p = 0.001), thereby supporting hypotheses H2b. Table 8 also indicates that for each unit
increase in vulnerabilities in the organizational environment, the odds
of ransomware attacks increase by 2.734 times compared to other
cyberattacks (p = 0.098). This finding supports hypothesis H3. In
contrast, if information security governance is properly implemented in
an organization, for an increase in every cybersecurity role, the probability of ransomware attacks decreases to 0.421 times that of nonransomware attacks (p = 0.100), thereby supporting hypothesis H4.
Next, in the RRA module, we used the M1, M2, and M3 models to
classify attacks as R or NR. The performances of the three models were
measured and compared on the test dataset using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as shown in Table 9.
It is evident from Table 9 that M1 was better than M2 and M3
because its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were better than
those of the other two models. Hence, this study further elaborates on
the results of M1 (the LR model). Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show that M1 could
correctly classify or predict 27 out of 29 R and 293 out of 314 NR data
points of the test dataset.
The likelihood of ransomware attacks, compared with the M1 model
tended to follow a Weibull distribution (mean = 0.12, standard deviation = 1.12, scale parameter = 0.05, and shape parameter = 0.89). This
means that large cyberattacks are infrequent in nature, and the frequency tends to decrease as patches are released for known vulnerabilities in IT systems. This finding is consistent with hypothesis H5a.
4.3.2. RRQ
In the previous RRA step, M1 (LR) was considered to be better than
M2 (NB) and M3 (DT). Hence, the M1 model of RRA was selected for
further evaluation. The risk (qi) obtained using LR was provided as input
to the RRQ to compute the ELi. The resultant severity or ELi followed a
gamma distribution (mean = 1.9, standard deviation = 668.7, scale
parameter = 1271.8, and shape parameter = 922.21). Large losses due
to cyberattacks are few in number, whereas there are many smaller
losses. This finding is consistent with hypothesis H5b.
4.3.3. RRM
Based on q and EL obtained from the RRA and RRQ, each data point
of the test set was plotted on a 2 × 2 risk–severity heat matrix, as shown
in Fig. 4. Each data point represents the risk exposure of an organization
due to a ransomware attack. Most organizations that faced R attacks
were in quadrant Q1 (high, high), with a few in Q4 (high, low). In
contrast, more than 90% of the organizations that faced NR attacks were
present in Q3 (low, low), with a few in Q2.
This study provides insight into the investments made by organizations in various quadrants of the PDDRRR ransomware mitigation
strategies. Fig. 5(a) depicts the level of investment in the six phases of
the ransomware risk mitigation strategies based on the quadrant of the
risk–severity matrix in which the organization is positioned.
Fig. 5(a) shows that the organizations in Q1 (high, high) attempted
to enhance their self-protection by investing in technological interventions, as indicated by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Harrison et al., 2022; NIST, 2022; Ramesh & Menen, 2020). They made
higher investments (H-H-H-H-H-H) in the PDDRRR mitigation strategies, thereby moving from Q1 (high, high) to Q2 (high, low) and
reducing the risk by 45.24% and severity by 50%, as shown in Fig. 5(b).
This result supports hypothesis 6(a).
Fig. 5(a) shows that organizations in Q2 (high, low) made less
technological investment in the preparation and deterring phases
compared to other stages (L-L-H-H-H-H) of mitigation strategies
(PDDRRR). They invested more in recovering the infected systems from
the backup data, as suggested by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

(Harrison et al., 2022; NIST, 2022; Ramesh & Menen, 2020), thereby
reducing the severity and consequently moving from Q2 (high, low) to
Q3 (low, low) and reducing the risk by 47.83% and severity by 46.67%,
as shown in Fig. 5(b). This finding supports Hypothesis 6b.
Fig. 5(a) indicates that the organizations in Q3 (low, low) maintained
low overall technological investments (L-L-L-L-L-L) in all phases of the
PDDRRR mitigation strategies. Once the organization reaches Q3 (low,
low), it becomes eligible to transfer risk by investing in cyber-risk
insurance (Muhly et al., 2022). This mitigation strategy is in accordance
with previous studies (Straub & Welke, 1998; Mukhopadhyay et al.,
2013). Once they can reduce their probability of attack and further
reduce the severity of the attack, they can lower their cybersecurity
investments, which is in accordance with COR theory. This result supports hypothesis 6c.
Finally, Fig. 5(a) shows that the organizations in Q4 (high, low)
made high technological investments in the prepare and deter phases

(NIST, 2022) and moderate investments (H-H-M-M-M-M) in other phases of PDDRRR, thereby moving from Q4 (high, low) to Q3 (low, low)
and reducing their risk by 18.33% and severity by 20%, as shown in
Fig. 5(b). This result supports hypothesis 6d.
5. Qualitative study
5.1. Methodology
We interviewed participants from firms that had experienced a
cyberattack, firms and consultants that provided these organizations
with technological solutions, and cyber-risk insurers. For firms that had
experienced cyberattacks, we interviewed people from multiple levels in
the organization’s cybersecurity, such as chief executive officers, chief
risk managers, chief technology officers, CISOs, IT teams, cybersecurity
consultants, and security architects. Next, we interviewed third-party
vendors, such as managed security service providers, consultants, and
perimeter security providers of EDR, XDR, SIEM, and SOAR. We also
interviewed cyber insurance managers and underwriters. A total of 80
professionals, including practitioners and researchers, participated in
the semi-structured interviews. Thereafter, we conducted data triangulation (Sarker et al., 2012) across participants belonging to firms that
faced cyberattacks, consultants who provided them with technological
solutions, and cyber-risk insurers.
We interviewed participants from firms that faced cyberattacks and
consultants that provided these firms with technological solutions to
establish the following dependencies: large firms in the critical sector
with multiple channels of online distribution are prone to ransomware
attacks, unless effective network segmentation is in place; the ransomware spreads easily across the firm; the severity of vulnerabilities in
software, hardware, and networks are explored by hackers to compromise systems; and effective security governance practices and control
can help to reduce ransomware attacks on the firm. Next, we interviewed cyber insurers to understand the frequency with which cyberattacks occur on a firm and their claim payout distributions. In addition,
we attempted to understand how to mitigate risk by determining the
proportion of accept, reduce, or transfer.
5.2. Results
5.2.1. RRA
In this study, we use predictive analytics techniques to carry out a
firm’s ransomware risk assessment.
5.2.1.1. Organizational structure. The respondents highlighted that
larger organizations, although better equipped with security technologies, can still be attacked by advanced persistent threat (APT) tools such
as ransomware, which will cause serious business implications. Such
attacks tend to bring the supply chain of the firm to a standstill. Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO) of a firm noted that.
“Large organizations like ours are facing a lot ransomware attacks
lately. Unless you pay the ransom…which is a lot a money……in
bitcoins ……. your daily operations come to a standstill. You lose a
lot of business !!”
Representatives of a noted that Anti-virus company stated.
“In the last few quarters, we have sold many end-point security (EPS)
software to large organizations…. Our EPS has capabilities to alert
and protect against ransomware”
If the healthcare, finance, or public administration delivery systems
belonging to the critical sector are compromised by a hacker, the upstream and downstream of the value chain can be crippled. A manager of
a firm in a critical sector highlighted that.
“We could not access of our customer data, we could not fulfil orders,
and shopfloor was idle and we were at loss.”
A manager of a downstream firm along the value chain of the critical
sector added:
“We almost ran out of stock…. there was no replenishment coming
in…. customer queues to the call centre and the store were piling
up… it was really bad day. There was chaos all around”
5.2.1.2. Technological factors. Respondents noted that digital intensity
of a firm increases its market footprint, and therefore, revenue. However, it also carries the inherent risk of being compromised by hackers,
which can adversely effect their reputation and lead to customer churn.
A manager of a firm in a critical sector said:
“We have substantial revenues coming from the online channel. Our
IT team tell me that the security operations Centre (SOC) is flooded
with attempts by hackers to break in everyday”
The IT manager added.
“I have to keep increasing my cost to project to ensure that the online
operations are up, running and secure 24 × 7.”
Cybersecurity domain experts believe that network segmentation
within an organization helps to minimize the impact of ransomware
attacks. A senior Security Architect noted.
“Shrink the target and the impact zone through the principles of
networking such as micro segmentation to combat ransomware.
Network segmentation limits lateral movement, minimizing damage
and reducing the risk of widespread compromise.”
5.2.1.3. Vulnerability assessment. We found that security experts used
an open framework or a universal language to understand the characteristics and severity of software, hardware, or network vulnerabilities
in any organization. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of a firm
noted that.
“Constantly out IT team is on the lookout to prioritise out Cybersecurity efforts against ransomware attacks. How easy it is for attackers to exploit vulnerability in our system? What level of access is
required to carry out a breach? Is easy or quite difficult to execute an
attack? Finally assess the impact of the attack based what it comprises in the Confidentiality-Identity-Availability (CIA) triad”
5.2.1.4. Information security governance. Information security governance is the cornerstone of the cybersecurity posture of a firm. A welldefined governance structure ensures a coordinated incident response
approach and enhances resilience against cyber threats. A strong
framework promotes the rollout of effective controls, secure practices,
and alignment with organizational objectives. Chief Information Security Officer of a firm noted that:
“Success doesn’t happen my chance. It’s all about doing things well,
doing things reliably by implementing the security controls. This will
give your firm the expected outcomes”.
Chief Risk Manager of a cyber risk insurance firm noted that.
“we study the governance of a company …….who is in charge what
sort of budget do
you have in place do you have a dedicated governance… who’s
managing the decision at the end of the day”.
5.2.1.5. Likelihood of a ransomware attack. We observed that cyberinsurance providers examine the distribution of cyberattacks before
determining their premiums. In this context, the Weibull distribution is
A. Mukhopadhyay and S. Jain

13
optimal. A cyber security team member noted that:
“There are a huge number of cyber attacks that last for a shorter
period of time… however those that last for longer are usually low in
count”.
A cyber insurance underwriter stated that:
“we consider the distribution of cyber attacks while we decide for the
premium payouts… we generally notice that there are multiple cyber
attacks which are of shorter duration… accordingly our premium
charges vary as per how the cyberattacks are distributed across the
time”
5.2.2. RRQ
The losses arising from ransomware attacks follow a long-tail distribution; that is, a gamma distribution. The CTO noted that:
“Our main focus is on the cyber-attacks that are few in count but
incur huge damages… Wannacry as you know was a monster in this
sense”
A cyber insurance underwriter stated that:
“Long tail distributions generally help us to understand cyber insurance claims… this is mainly because the expected losses due to
cyber incidents are skewed in nature. ”
5.2.3. RRM
We created a heat-matrix (risk–severity) to understand the probability of a firm being attacked versus the impact of the ransomwareattack. Based on the location of the heat matrix, we propose a risk
mitigation trajectory to be followed by the CISO of a firm by investing in
security technology for PDDRRR. Cyber risk consultant stated that:
“heat matrix represents the organizational risk in a visually aiding
format. Heat matrix tells you whether in in the high-high box or the
low-low box or any other box. You can then plan for accept, reduce
and transfer risk accordingly”
Another Cyber risk consultant stated that.
“ To mitigate ransomware risk, we help the clients to understand
what processes or assets inside their organization need protection.
what safeguards or countermeasures they already have and what
they need to get additionally… how to detect the security incidents
quickly… what activities can help restrain the spread of ransomware… and last but not the least how to recover digital systems”
If a firm experiences a high likelihood of attack and a high impact of
a ransomware attack, the CISO should attempt to reduce the cyber risk
by investing in cybersecurity technology. CISO of a firm stated that.
“we have invested a lot of money in IT infrastructure protection,
perimeter security, application security, identity access management, data security and backup to be resilient against ransomware
attacks”
Chief Risk Manager of a cyber risk insurance firm noted that.
“we will generally recommend that CISO to implement proper controls like multi factor authentication, patch management, end point
detection, cybers security awareness, cyber incidence response
planning and testing, and digital supply chain management, this
helps I risk reduction”
If a firm experiences a low likelihood of attack, but a high impact
from a ransomware attack, the CISO should attempt to self-insure
against cyber risk by investing in cybersecurity measures that reduce
the severity of ransomware attacks. CISO of a firm stated that.
“cybersecurity essentially is an insurance… So any measure that one
takes to improve the cybersecurity of their business is self-insurance
in this space… The flip side to that is very few events will finish your
business since it’s not really a super huge focus, especially if it’s not
one that they’ve encountered before… So you literally are going to
the casino if you don’t have anything in place.”
CTO of a firm stated that.
“if you can afford to take the bumps you know some unusual expense
coming along doesn’t really hurt you that much why would you
waste your money paying the insurance premiums… Invest in your
BCP DR activities so as to minimize your cyber attack losses…”
If a firm experiences a low likelihood of attack and low impact from a
cyberattack, it can opt for cyber-risk insurance to transfer the residual
cyber risk and protect itself from future losses against a ransomware
attack. Chief Risk Manager of a cyber risk insurance stated that:
“ buying cyber risk insurance about risk transfer. I’s all about technology plus cyber risk insurance to offload that risk.”
Another Cyber risk underwriter said.
“We complement all of your plans and risk management and reinforce your resilience.
it’s not there to replace security it’s there as an additional tool”.
CEO of a firm stated that.
“Board of governors in our firm deals with the risk including operational risks. They also suggest we take cyber risk insurance against
downtime, and loss customer data”
If a firm experiences a high likelihood of cyberattack but with a low
impact from the attack, it can opt for self-insurance; that is, investments
in cyber technological interventions such as firewalls, antivirus, and
IDPs/IPSs, to reduce the probability of ransomware attacks. CTO states
that:
“Anything you invest into to defend your boundaries from bad actors. or to reduce the chances of your organization getting hit by
these cyber threats. is a self- insurance. when I know that my likelihood of getting attacked is high. may be because I operate in a
critical sector the cyber attackers have their eyes on…then why
would I not keep my money aside in strengthening my peripheries…”
Cyber security team expert quoted:
“When my company started investing in pre-attack mitigation strategies. I see a huge drop in the cyber security events.”
6. Discussion
This study has used a mixed-method explanatory approach (Ballerini
et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2021; Kar & Dwivedi, 2020; Maier et al.,
2023; Mikalef et al., 2019; Wunderlich et al., 2019) to examine the
research questions. First, the quantitative R2M2 was developed. The
R2M2 model consists of three modules. The RRA module lists the
possible causes of a ransomware attack. We tested our hypotheses using
the generalized linear models. We found that larger organizations are
more susceptible to such attacks, which is consistent with previous
studies that highlighted the attractiveness of such organizations to
ransomware attackers because of their ability to pay larger ransoms and
their possession of critical data (Angst et al., 2017; Brewer, 2016;
Mansfield-Devine, 2016). However, regardless of their size, organizations should invest in countermeasures (Yuryna Connolly et al., 2020).
The results also indicate that organizations belonging to critical industries are prone to ransomware attacks, which aligns with previous
studies that highlighted the critical nature of these daily operations as an
enticing target for attackers (Javed Butt et al., 2019). Previous studies
also showed that firms in the critical sector tend to have low risk
tolerance to ransomware attacks (Samonas et al., 2020; Tsen et al.,
A. Mukhopadhyay and S. Jain 
International Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102724
14
2022) and tend to address known vulnerabilities (CERT-In, 2023). In
addition, the findings demonstrate that organizations with high digital
intensity have an increased risk of ransomware attacks, as also indicated
by previous studies (Kim & Kwon, 2019; McLeod & Dolezel, 2018; Smith
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the results indicate that network segmentation in firms decreases the likelihood of ransomware attacks because it
hinders the lateral movement of ransomware traffic, thereby maintaining critical files or servers separate from internet entry points. This
aligns with the findings of previous studies (Conti et al., 2018; Shu et al.,
2017).
The results demonstrate that organizations with higher vulnerability
tend to have a higher probability of facing ransomware attacks. This
aligns with previous studies that emphasized the role of employees
(Wong et al., 2022) as a weak link in cybersecurity, despite significant
investments in IT security (FIRST, 2019; Zhuang et al., 2020). Attackers
exploit social engineering to target such employees, leading to breaches
in CIA (O’Kane et al., 2018; Oz et al., 2022). Fewer restrictive privileges
required to run an application also contribute to increased vulnerability
(Peters, 2017).
Finally, the findings confirm that effective information security
governance reduces the likelihood of ransomware attacks. The presence
of CSR within organizations ensures the proper implementation of IT
controls, thereby enhancing cybersecurity (Fazlida & Said, 2015;
Weixun Li et al., 2023).
As in previous studies (Bardhan et al., 2015; Biswas et al., 2022; Lin
et al., 2017; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019), the probability of ransomware
attacks was computed using predictive analytics such as LR. The probability of ransomware attacks follows a Weibull distribution (Hossack
et al., 1983), whereas the expected losses exhibit a gamma distribution
(Dutta & Perry, 2006; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019).
Our qualitative study also validated the findings of the quantitative
study (Ballerini et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2021; Kar & Dwivedi, 2020;
Maier et al., 2023; Mikalef et al., 2019; Wunderlich et al., 2019). We
could reinforce these relationships by conducting interviews with respondents from firms that had experienced a cyberattack, firms and
consultants that provided them with technological solutions, and
cyber-risk insurers. It was confirmed that large firms in the critical sector
with multiple channels of online distribution are prone to ransomware
attacks unless they have effective network segmentation, if they have
unpatched severe vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and networks,
and if they do not implement effective security governance practices and
control. We also noted that cyber-insurers tend to focus on learning the
frequency of cyberattacks and their impact. Finally, the CISO determines
the proportion of risk to accept, reduce or transfer.
6.1. Theoretical contributions
The quantitative R2M2 contributes to the literature by holistically
assessing, quantifying, and mitigating ransomware attacks by considering the concepts of PMT (Li et al., 2019), COR theory, RCT, trade-off
theory, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Previous studies
mainly focused on variables related to ransomware binaries (i.e., static
or dynamic features). However, the proposed RRA module considers the
process view of a ransomware attack as guided by the CKC. The attacker
performs reconnaissance of the IT environment of an organization and
exploits its vulnerabilities. Hence, this study considered the severity of
the vulnerabilities to assess the ransomware risk to an organization.
Moreover, it considered the implementation of information security
governance and other cybersecurity measures deployed by an organization, such as the encryption of data and segmentation of networks, to
neutralize the CKC. We used predictive analysis techniques such as NB,
DT, and LR to determine the likelihood of a ransomware versus
non-ransomware attack. The RRQ module contributes to the quantification of the ransomware risk from a financial perspective and indicates
that the likelihood of a ransomware attack follows a Weibull distribution, whereas its severity follows a gamma distribution. Finally, the RRM
module helps the CISO to visualize the risk and severity of the attack to
which the organization is exposed on a heat matrix. Finally, the proposed mitigation techniques for the CISO are based on academic solutions (Straub & Welke, 1998) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,
which is commonly used industry practice (NIST, 2014b, 2018). The
proposed best practices, such as vulnerability assessment, block payload
delivery, and block C&C communication, are primarily for pre- and
post-ransomware attacks. The model uses a cost-benefit analysis (Gordon et al., 2003a) in the background based on the risk and severity as per
the heat matrix before proposing the technological intervention to
reduce the risk, followed by self-insurance and cyber-risk insurance.
Based on the risk severity portfolio, the technological investments into
the PDDRRR mitigation strategies (NIST, 2022) can be prioritize. For
instance, an organization deters attackers by ensuring that the information is encrypted such that even if they have access to it, they are
unable to decipher it. Likewise, regularly backing up an organization’s
data will help restore it in the event of information theft. Finally, the
model suggests how organizations can increase their eligibility to cover
the residual risks of cyber insurance. Our qualitative study also validated
the findings of the quantitative study (Ballerini et al., 2023; Dwivedi
et al., 2021; Kar & Dwivedi, 2020; Maier et al., 2023; Mikalef et al.,
2019; Wunderlich et al., 2019). We could reinforce these relationships
by conducting interviews with respondents from firms that had experienced a cyberattack, firms, and consultants that provided them with
technological solutions, and cyber-risk insurers.
6.2. Implications for practice
Our study can help the CISO to assess the risk and severity of ransomware attacks. First, we recommend that the CISO of a large organization operating in the critical sector (such as healthcare, power and
energy, infrastructure, and finance) has multiple online channels that
are frequently prone to reconnaissance studies by hackers. To minimize
such attacks, the CISO should invest in perimeter security elements such
as firewalls, antivirus, and IDSs, and encrypt their data. This will help to
prevent a ransomware attack vector from attacking the IT systems of
these organizations. We would also advise the CISO to carry out regular
training programs to sensitize and create awareness among employees
against clicking on phishing emails, as this is the most common mechanism for delivering the payload to the IT system of an organization.
Following this cyber-hygiene strategy will help the CISO to impose a
strict cyber-posture against ransomware attacks. Second, we recommend that the CISO implements a network segmentation strategy to
reduce the probability of the ransomware vector not traveling across the
organizational network. The main objective of the CISO is to ensure that
the ransomware cannot install any payload on the IT assets. Third, the
CISO should carry out a vulnerability assessment to understand the
points of weakness in software, hardware, and networks. The CISO
should ensure that the vulnerabilities are patched regularly so that the
hacker does not access execute an attack, which could lead to a
compromise of the CIA triad. Fourth, the CISO should ensure that IT
governance practices are effectively rolled out, so that the hacker is
deterred from breaching the IT assets, communicating to the remote
C&C center, encrypting it, and in some cases, exfiltrating the data. Fifth,
our study can help the CISO to determine the likelihood of ransomware
attacks. On this basis, the CISO can plan investments in cybersecurity
elements to deter ransomware attacks. Sixth, this study can provide the
CISO with an estimate of the expected loss if a ransomware attack occurs. Seventh, the study can help the chief technology officer to visualize
the cyber-risk status of the firm on a heat matrix (likelihood of attack ×
impact of attack). The model will help the CISO to decide on technological investments (NIST, 2022) for PDDRRR mitigation strategies and
to assign priorities (high/medium/low). These mitigation strategies are
in accordance with well-established industry frameworks, such as the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework, for warding off cyberattacks. Eighth, if
an organization faces a high probability and high severity of a
A. Mukhopadhyay and S. Jain 
International Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102724
15
ransomware attack, the model suggests that the CISO prioritizes investments in cybersecurity technologies for PDDRRR. For instance, the
CISO should regularly monitor the digital assets and processes of the
firm by performing vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
This is because our model informs the CISO that the severity of vulnerabilities in the IT environment is directly proportional to the likelihood of an organization being attacked by ransomware. These
technological investments will help the CISO to reduce the probability
and severity of ransomware attacks. Ninth, if the organization faces a
high probability and low severity of a ransomware attack, the model
proposes that the CISO should focus on reducing the probability of a
ransomware attack through self-insurance. This would include allocating sufficient budgets tosecurity technologies. For instance, data can
be encrypted and and backed up, network segmentation can be implemented to contain ransomware attacks by blocking payload delivery,
and BCP/DR can be implemented. Tenth, if the organization faces a low
probability and high severity of a ransomware attack, the CISO can
invest in technologies that can minimize the losses due to the ransomware attack. Finally, if the organization faces a low risk and low severity
of ransomware attacks, the CISO can invest in cyber insurance to
transfer the residual risk and protect the organization from future ransomware attacks. Using this model, the CISO can visualize the increasing
strength of ransomware techniques with burgeoning information technology capabilities, such as unbreakable encryption (AES 256-bit
encryption), anonymous payments (cryptocurrency), platform agnostic
ransomware (RaaS), and target-specific attacks (TickBots). This will
motivate the CISO to enhance cybersecurity investments as the technological capabilities of the firm increase and improve the cybersecurity
posture of the firm. This can help to protect firms from facing downtime
and customer churn and, consequently, losing their reputation.
6.3. Limitations and future research
A limitation of this study is that limited organizational features were
considered owing to the scarcity of data. This is mainly because firms
facing ransomware attacks are reluctant to share the profile or attack
data of their organizations. Future studies can also examine other parameters to determine the importance of ransomware risk mitigation
strategies. One such parameter could be the strategic goals of firms. The
cybersecurity mitigation methods can be prioritized based on the strategic IT plan of an organization.
7. Conclusion
This study has used a mixed-method explanatory approach to propose a the R2M2 model that holistically assesses, quantifies, and mitigates ransomware. We assessed ransomware attack risk using the
organizational structure, network characteristics, and environmental
vulnerability score as inputs. Next, the expected loss due to a ransomware attack on a firm in critical industry was estimated. We also positioned each firm in a heat matrix (probability of attack × impact). This
model informs the CISO of the probability of a ransomware attack on the
firm and the corresponding estimated loss due to the attack. The model
also provides a mitigation strategy for the CISO of a firm that is located
in the (high, high) quadrant of the heat matrix to resort to self-protection
by investing in cybersecurity technologies, regular monitoring of digital
assets and processes, safeguarding the perimeters of the organization,
effectively segmenting the network, backing up and encrypting the data,
training the employees, and creating awareness among employees
regarding ransomware attack risk, as well as implementing control and
information security governance strategies. If the firm lies in the (high,
low) and (low, high) quadrants, the CISO should opt for self-insurance;
that is, invest in cyber technology tools to reduce the probability of a
ransomware attack and then create a contingency fund to make good the
loss arising from a ransomware attack on the firm. If the firm lies in the
(low, low) quadrant of the heat matrix, the CISO can transfer the cyber
risk to a cyber-risk insurer upon payment of a premium. Finally, we
validated the above findings through a qualitative study by interviewing
participants from firms affected by ransomware, managed security service providers, security consultants, and cyber-risk insurers.
