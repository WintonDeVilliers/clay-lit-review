I. A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS OF CYBERSECURITY
The Internet and cyberspace are inseparable aspects of everyone’s life. Cyberspace is a
concept that describes widespread, interconnected, and online digital technology. Cyberspace
refers to the online world that is separate from everyday reality. Since the internet and the virtual world are very recent advances in human lives, there are many unknown and unpredictable
aspects to it that sometimes can be catastrophic to users in financial aspects [1]–[6], high-tech
industry [7]–[13], and even life-threatening aspects in healthcare [14]–[20]. Cybersecurity
failures are usually caused by human errors or their lack of knowledge. According to the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) X-Force Threat Intelligence Index in
2020, around 8.5 billion in records were compromised in 2019 due to failures of insiders,
which is an increase of more than 200 percent compared to the number of records that were
compromised in 2018. In another survey performed by the Ernst & Young Global Information
Security during 2018-2019, it is reported that 34% percent of the organizations stated that
the employees who are inattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal
vulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that phishing is the
main threat to them [21]. As stated earlier, it is noteworthy to mention that inattentive users
arXiv:2303.13621v1 [cs.HC] 22 Jan 2023
are one of the reasons for data breaches and cyberattacks. In fact, the National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC) in the United Kingdom observed that 23.2 million users who were victims
of cybersecurity attacks used a carelessly selected password, which is “123456”, as their
account password. On the other hand, the Annual Cybersecurity Report published by Cisco
in 2018 announced that phishing and spear phishing emails are the root causes of a good
number of cybersecurity attacks in recent years. Given the examples above, enhancing the
cybersecurity behaviors of both personal users and organizations can protect vulnerable users
from cyber threats. In fact, both human factors and technological aspects of cybersecurity
should be addressed in organizations for a safer environment.
There are multiple environmental influences studied as factors that contribute to cybersecurity behaviors that emerge from the interaction of an individual operating in a cyber
environment, which are listed below:
1) Organizational Culture for Information Security Management [22]: Chang and
Lin mentioned that the information security technologies utilized in organizations are
insufficient for information security management. Hence, although such strategies are
important and necessary to be implemented whether at the intra-organizational level
or across inter-organizational partners, organizations should also adopt a combination
of information security and organization culture aspects. In other words, organizations
should both monitor the “outside” patterns and threats and the “inside” human nature such
as relationships and activities among employees that are mostly hidden and unconscious.
The organizational culture for information security can be categorized as follows:
• Cooperativeness: The cooperativeness trait refers to the internal culture of cooperation, trust, team work, empowerment, and information sharing inside the organizations. Such behavioral traits create a friendly environment among peers and
colleagues and prepares a platform for all members to share information and trust
each other such as an extended family. Internal cyberattacks in such a friendly
environment is less likely.
• Innovation: Although this trait may not directly be connected to information security, an organization that promotes creativity, entrepreneurship, and adaptability
will benefit from creativity of employees in all aspects including the cybersecurity
2
domain to protect against cyberattacks.
• Consistency: The consistency trait emphasizes on order, rules and regulations, uniformity, and efficiency. A consistent organization is usually a formalized and regularized company in which cyberattacks and information breaches are less likely.
• Effectiveness: The effectiveness trait has an emphasis on production, goal achievement, and benefit-oriented measures. A company that empowers such traits in its
employees would have a lower risk in cybersecurity attacks and information leak.
The four aforementioned constructs of an organization are initiated using 26 items that
are adapted from instruments measuring the culture of a company [23]–[26].
2) Policies, Participation in the Security Education, Training, and Awareness Program [27]: Han et al. mention that most organizations utilize security technologies
to induce the employees to comply with Information Security Policies (ISP). However, the state-of-the-art literature on ISP compliance found out that in addition to
technology advances in information security, behavioral and social approaches should
also be employed to avoid information breaches. The research results by Han et al.
suggests that psychological contract fulfillment help mitigating the adverse effects of
costs on the information security compliance intention in supervisor teams. Furthermore,
employees which are aware of policies by participating in the security education, training,
and awareness programs, are anticipated to act in accordance with the information
security policies since they are aware of the avails of complying with the information
security policies. This study considers a bilateral perspective that compares supervisor
and supervisee groups. The reason for separating the supervisor groups from supervisee
groups in this study is that these two groups usually have different employment qualities,
they are usually in different age groups, they usually differ in their social status and
work experiences. As a result, the effects of psychological contracts on their behavior
in the organizations may differ. The results in the study by Han et al. demonstrate that
the impact of psychological contract fulfillment on the information security policies
compliance is more considerable for managers than for their supervisees. Although
the work by Han et al. focuses on the psychological contract effects on information
security policy compliance for supervisor groups only, there is a lot of opportunities
3
in studying other personalized features of employees, such as job position or tenure,
age, work experience, and social status to elaborate other factors that influence the
information security policy compliance. In a related cross-culture study by Hovav and
D’Arcy [28], they showed that social status, age, and gender influence the intention
to misuse information security among Korean users. In particular, more high-ranking
members of organizations who have access to more sensitive and crucial information
are more plausible to breach the information security policies. Such misuses by senior
members of organizations can lead to catastrophic consequences for the company. As a
result, it is more important to enforce the perception of psychological contract fulfillment
in the supervisors groups rather than the supervisee groups to reinforce the information
security policy compliance intention.
3) Organizational Structure [29]:
Among factors that instigates information security breaches are behavioral and psychological characteristics. There are numerous studies in the literature that address the
influencing factors of information security policy compliance behavior in companies.
However, in the study by Hong and Furnell, they consider the influence of organizational
structures. The authors integrate the theory of planned behavior and the perceived organizational formalization to study the procedure used to form the information security policy
compliance behavioral intentions. Authors use the data from a survey of organization
employees, in which 261 people take part, and the results of the data analysis utilizing
the structural equation modeling is as follows. The empirical results suggests that the
behavioral habits and cognitive processes theorized by the theory of planned behavior
are notably affected by the perceived organizational formalization. This research study
proposes that in an effort to enhance the employee information security policy compliance
intentions and behavioral habits, organizations are recommended to plan a formalized set
of procedures, rules, communications, and policies in general. Additionally, this study
has the following results. i) Subjective norms can positively influence attitude, perceived
behavioral control, and deterrence certainty, and attitude and perceived behavioral control
showed strong positive influences on behavioral intention. ii) The decision-making process for information security policy compliance has been demonstrated to be significantly
4
influenced by organizational formalization. Organizational formalization, in particular,
had a favorable impact on attitudes toward information security behavior, perceived
behavioral control, and subjective norms. iii) Deterrent certainty and behavioral habit
can both benefit from organizational formalization. iv) Perceived behavioral control can
encourage behavior, and deterrence certainty can encourage information security policy
compliance. v) Although subjective norms do not have a direct impact on behavioral
intention to comply with information security policies, they do influence it through the
mediating effects of attitudes, deterrent certainty, and perceived behavioral control.
4) Managerial Participation, and Leadership [30], [31]: An important aspect of behavioral cybersecurity in organizations is the influence of management leadership on the
information security behavior of employees. However, the importance of leadership role
in the context of cybersecurity has not been explored extensively. This gap in the literature
regarding the influence of leadership on the information security behavior of employees
is addressed in the work by Guhr et al. [30]. The research by Guhr et al. utilizes an
interactional psychology approach to link the elements of the full-range leadership model
to employees’ security compliance and participation intentions. Guhr et al. evaluate a
multitheoretical model on a proprietary data set that includes 322 people from more
than 14 branches across the globe. This research adds to the body of knowledge in the
fields of information security and cybersecuriy by investigating the way that different
leadership approaches improve the intended information security behavior of employees.
The empirical results by Guhr et al. highlight the significance of transformational management as it can have an impact on the behavior of employee on extra-role and in-role
levels regarding information security. In a related work by Hu et al. [31], an individual
behavioral model is developed that combines the theory of planned behavior with the
role of management and the culture of the company in order to realize the effects of
management on the employees’ security compliance behavior. Hu et al. find out that
the attitudes of Employees toward the perceived and subjective norms of behavioral
control over compliance with information security regulations are notably influenced by
top management participation in information security activities. They also discover that
top management involvement has a remarkable impact on corporate culture, which in
5
turn has an impact on the attitudes of employees about the perceived behavioral control
over information security regulations. Additionally, Hu et al. discover that the impacts of
management involvement and organizational culture on employee behavioral intentions
are conciliated by employee cognitive assumptions regarding information security policy
compliance. In addition to the deterrence-oriented treatments offered in the literature,
their findings enhance the information security state-of-the-art research by showing the
way that management can play a proactive role in molding the compliance behavior of
employees.
It has been demonstrated that organizational support for employees inline with information
security, as a crucial environmental factor, can play an important role in enhancing productive
performance of employees in regards with cyberattacks and information breaches [32]. In a
related research article, Warkentin et al. indicated that employees who have necessary access
to situational support such as help from managers and colleagues, practicing behaviors, and
interpersonal help, tend to be conductive to their self-efficacy regarding their information
security behaviors. An extensive study on the behavioral factors in cybersecurity is undertaken in the work by Hong and Furnell [21] to support the hypotheses that, a) “Behavioral
comprehensiveness will have a positive impact on habits”, b) “Self-efficacy will have a positive
impact on habits”, c) “Response efficacy will have a positive impact on habits”, d) “Selfefficacy will have a positive impact on behavioral comprehensiveness”, e) Response efficacy
will have a positive impact on behavioral comprehensiveness, f) “Situational support will have
a positive impact on self-efficacy”, and g) “Situational support will have a positive impact
on response efficacy”. Hong and Furnell use cross-sectional survey to evaluate their research
model. According to the 41st Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, 25.4%
of the 772 million internet users are students, which is the highest proportion of internet
users. Since students use internet for numerous purposes such as attending online classes
and workshops, doing online shopping, interacting with social media, and sending emails
and receiving emails, they are very vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. As a result, college
students are used as the participants in Hong and Furnell’s study. The total number of 432
students took part in the survey, out of which 393 of the questionnaire were included for
the statistical analysis. The demography of the respondents are as follows. 200 males (51%)
6
and 193 female participants (49%) responded to the questionnares, where 39 were freshmen
(first-year students) (10%), 108 were sophomores (second-year students, 27%) , 169 were
juniors (third-year students, 43%), and 77 were seniors (fourth- and final-year students, 20%).
The measurements that are used in this study are explained below.
1) Situational support (SS): The SS factor is measured by adopting the approach utilized
by Warkentin et al. [33]. The Cronbach’s alpha factor of this scale is 0.906.
2) Self-efficacy (SE): The SE factor is measured by adopting the approach utilized by
Bulgurcu et al. [34] and Hu et al. [31]. The Cronbach’s alpha factor of this scale is
0.928.
3) Response efficacy (RE): The RE factor is measured by adopting the approach utilized
by Johnston & Warkentin [35]. The Cronbach’s alpha factor of this scale is 0.915.
4) Habit (HA): The HA factor is measured by adopting the approach utilized by Tsai et
al. [36]. The Cronbach’s alpha factor of this scale is 0.925.
5) Behavioral comprehensiveness (BC): The BC factor is measured by adopting the
approach utilized by Limayem et al. [37].
6) Control variables: Contr4ol variables such as gender, college major, grade, and other
scenarios can influence the information security compliance intention. Hence, such factors are taken into account in the data analysis of this study.
As shown in Figure 1, the loadings of all the items are greater than 0.5, all the composite
reliability (CR) values are greater than 0.7, and all the average variance extracted (AVE) values
are greater than 0.5. As a result, the assessment is considered to have a good convergent validity. Furthermore, the correlations between constructs that are presented in Figure 2 provide
support for the hypotheses of this work. In addition, the Bootstrap analysis of significance
test on serial multiple mediation effects of self-efficacy and behavioral comprehensiveness
are presented in Figure 3. The data analyses support the hypotheses that both self-efficacy
and response efficacy have a positive impact on behavioral comprehensiveness; situational
support has a positive impact on both self-efficacy and response efficacy; and Situational
support can promote cybersecurity behavioral habits through the serial multiple mediating
effects of self-efficacy and behavioral comprehensiveness.
There is no doubt that breaches of data can be damaging in cyberattacks. As an example,

the cyberattack on the Ukraine power grid in 2015 resulted in 225, 000 people to experience
power outage [38]. It is observed that the average ransom attack jumped from $373 and $294
in 2014 and 2015, respectively, to $1077 in 2016 [38]. Hence, it is crucial to establish a
strong curriculum in both high schools and undergraduate schools to familiarize the internet
users with the consequences of cyberattacks and information theft [39], [40].

II. FUTURE WORK
In the context of cybersecurity and information security, one of the common themes is to
approach employees of large organizations via phishing emails. In such emails, employees
are incentivized with immediate rewards and tempting offers to click on links or download
documents; as a result of which, an information breach occurs. The phishing emails are
usually sent to victims at the end of working hours or when they are fatigued. As a solution
to avoid information breaches as a result of employees’ fatigue, two approaches are presented
below:
1) Creating identifiers: Most employees of large companies and organizations communicate via email internally. As a result, the emails that are sent from external email
addresses can be labelled with an identifier so that employees pay more attention to
them. As an example, the employees, including the students, professors, and staff of the
University of Texas at Dallas are usually in contact with each other and send emails
internally. Hence, those emails that are sent via emails that are external to the University
of Texas at Dallas can be labelled for recipients.
2) Artificial Intelligence: As mentioned earlier, employees are usually the victims of
cyberattacks and phishing emails when they are fatigued. As a result, artificial intelligence
tools such as image processing and video processing can be used to identify the level
of fatigue of employees and warn them when the classification algorithms identify that
the employees are fatigued. Machine learning methods for classification and learning
can be used for fatigue detection of employees [41]–[51]. Relevant methods considering
the behavioral aspects of users are used in the literature [52]–[63]. This approach is
definitely more controversial compared to the first one, since employees may not like
to be monitored by image/video processing tools continuously during their work hours,
even if the data is deleted and not used elsewhere. The subconscious of human beings
is in a way that prefers not to be monitored, but in any case, those employees who are
willing to use such a tool can benefit from the fatigue recognition aspect at the expense
of being monitored.
