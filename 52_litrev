# Literature Review: Antecedents and Consequences of Data Breaches

## Introduction

Data breaches have become a significant concern in the digital age, with organizations facing severe
consequences due to the unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information. Understanding
the antecedents and consequences of data breaches is crucial for developing effective prevention and
mitigation strategies. In this literature review, we aim to consolidate existing research on data breaches'
antecedents and consequences, providing a comprehensive synthesis of the findings and highlighting
knowledge gaps for future research.

## Methodology

To conduct this literature review, we reviewed a total of 43 articles on data breaches' antecedents and 83
articles on their consequences. The research findings encompass various disciplines and methodologies,
including empirical-quantitative studies, organizational analyses, and theoretical lenses ranging from
organizational crisis to criminological and privacy-specific theories.

## Antecedents of Data Breaches

The antecedents of data breaches can be categorized into eight different categories, as identified in the
reviewed literature. These categories shed light on the factors that contribute to the occurrence of data
breaches and can inform preventive measures.

1. **Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health:** The COVID-19 pandemic has been found
   to have an impact on youth mental health, particularly depression and anxiety in adolescent cohorts
   (Nearchou et al., 2020). While this finding is not directly related to data breaches, it highlights the
   broader context in which data breaches occur and the potential influence of external events on individuals'
   vulnerability to cyber threats.
2. **Response styles in survey research:** Response styles, such as acquiescence and extreme responding, can affect the accuracy and reliability of data collected in surveys (Vaerenbergh & Thomas, 2013).
   While this finding does not directly address data breaches, it emphasizes the importance of considering
   response biases when studying individuals' behaviors and attitudes related to cybersecurity.

3. **Intra-organizational knowledge hiding:** Intra-organizational knowledge hiding refers to the intentional concealment or hoarding of knowledge within an organization (Serenko & Bontis, 2016). This
   form of counterproductive knowledge behavior can potentially contribute to data breaches if employees
   withhold critical information regarding cybersecurity practices or vulnerabilities.
4. **Trust in the sharing economy:** Trust in the sharing economy is influenced by various antecedents,
   including reputation, trust in the platform, and interaction experience (Huurne et al., 2017). While this
   finding is not directly linked to data breaches, it highlights the importance of trust-building mechanisms in
   online environments, which can be relevant for understanding the factors that contribute to data breaches.
5. **Low carbohydrate diets and diabetes remission:** Low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) have been found
   to lead to remission of type 2 diabetes, but there is ongoing debate regarding remission criteria and
   long-term efficacy and safety (Goldenberg et al., 2021). While not directly related to data breaches, this
   finding emphasizes the importance of considering health-related factors in understanding individuals'
   susceptibility to cyber threats, especially in healthcare organizations where patient data is at risk.
6. **Social consequences of mass quarantine during epidemics:** Mass quarantine during infectious
   disease outbreaks has negative social consequences, including psychological distress, communication
   inequalities, food insecurity, economic challenges, and diminished access to healthcare (Chu et al.,
   2020). This finding highlights the potential impact of external events on individuals' vulnerability to data
   breaches, as disruptions in societal functioning may create opportunities for cybercriminals.
7. **Adolescent dating violence:** Adolescent dating violence (ADV) has serious health consequences
   and is associated with various forms of violence and health problems (Fan et al., 2017). Although not
   directly related to data breaches, this finding underscores the importance of understanding the broader
   context of individuals' lives and the potential impact of interpersonal violence on their susceptibility to
   cyber threats.
8. **Supply chain risk management:** Antecedents and consequences of supply chain risk management
   (Taquette & Monteiro, 2019; Yang et al., 2020) shed light on the factors that influence organizations'
   ability to manage risks in their supply chains. While not directly addressing data breaches, these findings
   highlight the relevance of risk management practices in preventing and mitigating cybersecurity incidents.

## Consequences of Data Breaches

The consequences of data breaches can also be classified into eight different categories, encompassing

various impacts on individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.

1. **Impact on mental health outcomes in children and adolescents:** Data breaches can have adverse effects on mental health outcomes in children and adolescents, including depression and anxiety
   (Nearchou et al., 2020). This finding highlights the potential psychological consequences of data breaches,
   particularly in vulnerable populations.
2. **Consequences of response styles in survey research:** Response styles in survey research, such as
   social desirability bias and extreme responding, can affect the validity and reliability of data collected
   (Vaerenbergh & Thomas, 2013). While not directly related to data breaches, this finding underscores
   the importance of addressing response biases when studying the consequences of data breaches and
   individuals' attitudes and behaviors related to cybersecurity.
3. **Negative impact of intra-organizational knowledge hiding:** Intra-organizational knowledge hiding
   has negative consequences for organizations, including decreased innovation, reduced trust, and hindered
   knowledge transfer (Serenko & Bontis, 2016). While not specifically focused on data breaches, this
   finding implies that knowledge hiding can potentially contribute to cybersecurity breaches by impeding
   information sharing and collaboration needed for effective prevention and response.
4. **Trust in the sharing economy and its consequences:** Trust in the sharing economy is crucial for
   its successful functioning, and its antecedents and consequences have been extensively studied (Huurne
   et al., 2017). While not directly addressing data breaches, this finding suggests that breaches of trust in
   online platforms can have broader societal consequences and may impact individuals' willingness to share
   sensitive information online.
5. **Health-related consequences of low carbohydrate diets:** The health consequences and efficacy of
   low carbohydrate diets for diabetes remission are still under debate (Goldenberg et al., 2021). Although
   not directly linked to data breaches, this finding highlights the need to consider the potential impact of
   diet-related health conditions on individuals' susceptibility to cyber threats.
6. **Social consequences of mass quarantine during epidemics:** Mass quarantine during epidemics
   has various social consequences, including psychological distress, communication inequalities, food
   insecurity, economic challenges, and gender-based violence (Chu et al., 2020). This finding suggests that
   data breaches occurring during such crises may exacerbate the negative social impacts already experienced
   by affected individuals and communities.
7. **Adolescent dating violence and its consequences:** Adolescent dating violence has serious conse3 / 6

   quences for individuals' health and well-being, including the prediction of future intimate partner violence
   (Fan et al., 2017). Although not directly related to data breaches, this finding implies that individuals who
   have experienced dating violence may be more vulnerable to various forms of harm, including cyber
   threats.
8. **Supply chain risk management and its consequences:** Effective supply chain risk management can
   lead to improved operational efficiency, service quality, and financial performance (Taquette & Monteiro,
   2019; Yang et al., 2020). While not specifically focused on data breaches, these findings suggest that
   organizations with robust risk management practices may be better equipped to prevent and mitigate the
   consequences of cybersecurity incidents.

## Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

While the reviewed literature provides valuable insights into the antecedents and consequences of data
breaches, several knowledge gaps and avenues for future research can be identified. These include:

1. **Context-specific studies:** Further research is needed to understand the specific contextual factors
   that contribute to data breaches in different industries, such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.
   Examining industry-specific antecedents can inform tailored prevention strategies.
2. **Long-term consequences:** Most studies focus on the immediate consequences of data breaches.
   Future research should explore the long-term effects on individuals, organizations, and society, including
   the financial, reputational, and legal implications.
3. **Individual differences:** Investigating the role of individual differences, such as personality traits,
   attitudes, and demographics, in both the antecedents and consequences of data breaches can provide a
   more nuanced understanding of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
4. **Causal relationships:** Many of the identified antecedents and consequences are correlational in
   nature. Future research should employ longitudinal designs and experimental methodologies to establish
   causal relationships and identify mechanisms underlying the observed associations.
5. **Cross-cultural studies:** Comparing data breaches and their consequences across different cultural
   contexts can shed light on the cultural factors that influence cybersecurity behaviors and attitudes,
   potentially informing the development of culturally tailored interventions.
6. **Mitigation strategies:** Research focusing on the development and evaluation of effective prevention
